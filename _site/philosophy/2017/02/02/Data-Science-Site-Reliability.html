    <p>First of all, if your sales and marketing infrastructure is not your very most important business infrastructure, don’t read any further … this Salebarn technology blog post is definitely not for people who do not have to worry about the quality of the interaction with their customers.</p>

<p>Second of all, this Salebarn technology blog post is about absolutely RELYING on web, mobile, SMS communication IT in order to effect a MORE DIRECT, MORE PERSONAL, MORE CONTINUOUS, HIGHER QUALITY relationship with your customers … if you have already permanently decided that you will never be able to trust a technological communication channel, don’t read any further … this Salebarn technology blog post is definitely not for people who do not understand that their customers WANT to be engaged primarily over technological communication channels, so that they don’t have to waste time driving around or doing things inefficiently in order to find interesting products, services, people.</p>

<p>Finally, this Salebarn technology blog post is NOT the solution to all of your problems in this topical realm … KNOWLEDGE is the solution to those problems and it will be necessary to continually upgrade and update that knowledge.  This particular blog post is intended to be somewhat evergreen – but it CANNOT POSSIBLY BE truly evergreen.  As with all podcasts, it will be dated even before it is published. If you find this blog post helpful, GREAT … no need to thank us; like all bloggers – we wrote this posting as part of our own training plan … if you find our approach to thinking about problems useful and want us to apply our expertise to YOUR particular problem, we are available for hire although we are not particularly anxious to find more work – and we certainly do not provide user-specific consultations for free.</p>

<h1 id="site-reliability">Site Reliability</h1>

<p>This post is about making your most important infrastructure MORE RELIABLE … it is about OWNING your network and building that trusted network from components that you cannot and should not trust, ie reliability is about REDUNDANCY and it is about SITUATIONAL AWARENESS of where the vulnerabilities and weaknesses are.</p>
