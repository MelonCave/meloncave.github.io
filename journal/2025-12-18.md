### 100 Topics in Neuroarchitecture and Supportive Environments for Brain Regrowth, Renewal, and Cognitive Health

Below is a curated list of 100 topics, organized into 10 thematic categories for clarity. These draw from principles of neuroarchitecture (e.g., how built spaces influence primitive brain patterns, neuroplasticity, and emotional well-being), environmental designs that foster renewal over rigidity, strategies for cognitive rewiring to combat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and integrated daily practices like exercise, self-discipline, recovery, and meditation. The focus is on promoting adaptive neural pathways, preventing "sclerosis" (neural hardening or fixed mindsets), and building cognitive reserve through interdisciplinary insights.
