How do we do annotification? Why does annotification matter?

Legal precedent and the manner in which supporting briefs are filed explains the power of annotification. Wikipedia edits show another side of annotification ... people are allowed to make edits, comment on edits, and revert edits ... even as the precedent is established and slow or almost impossible to change, but it does change. Annotification and the free speech of annotification should be open to the public.

Let's consider the example of [LawArXiv](./1.Projects/staging/82LawArXiv.md) and legal journals, legal scholarship, and legal briefs.
