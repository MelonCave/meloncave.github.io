## 2025-11-16 Journal

I look at weather forecasts, but I don't really believe them too much ... I do pay attention to what's supposed to happen in the next hour or two or six and I tend to know what the forecast looks like for the week ahead, even if I don't trust the forecast.

I find sports DATA, eg box scores from football games, to entertaining but I probably consume more of that than I should ... it's an addiction that I need to kick.

News is another matter; an old addiction which I have largely kicked -- I still follow developments in published science and technology [through pre-print archives], but I mostly could not possibly care any less about news or most current events even in the tech/science realm, but I guess that I probably should not be entirely detached, eg maybe it would be okay to know if WW III ***really actually is*** starting somewhere ... so I have been thinking about ways to get a daily dose of trending news WITHOUT HAVING TO USE FACEBOOK OR USE ANY FORM OF SOCIAL MEDIA OR NEWS FIREHOSE ... AI helps with this; but ONLY for summarizing bullshit that does not matter ... as an example, I asked Grok to help me out with a [concise 5-sentence summary of EACH one of the 25 of today's 25 most consequential news topics](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMi1jb3B5_8f8de588-eede-41a0-a843-ae9310aec5e1), as judged by related activity on X or Reddit or other fora, on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
