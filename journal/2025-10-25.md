Revisit PKM for implementing the simple ToDo lists of a Portfolio Lifestyle or at least job-finding INDEED workflow. It's a matter knowledgework applied to the Self.

**Simplicity is KING!!!**

We do not want to be distracted by the myths of imagined productivity of [100-Hours/Week in the AI Arms Race](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-race-tech-workers-schedule-1ea9a116). COLLABORATIVE workflows matter more, which means that simplicity is KING; although visuals still matter. For the sake of CONSISTENCY and the simple *consistent* self-appraisal of **consistency**, it's important to spend some time revisiting components of our [proposed] Personal Knowledge Management Systems.

Looking at whether we really even ***use*** the ideas from these things, rather than just playing *bullshit bingo* to stuff whitepapers with terminology and keywords maybe to support claims of "pioneering thought" or maybe to score higher on LLM algorithms.

MOST of the features that developers use to differentiate their tool are USELESS in collaborative workflows, [John Cougan points out why this is](https://x.com/johncoogan/status/1981781875640480245): 1) walled gardens or collaborations pop up to ... confuse or even block other collaborators, 2) almost nobody needs ***another*** spin on a feature, eg to summarize an email, yet another way to [triage emails](https://x.com/petergyang/status/1982092309673160860) ... *massive development and marketing/evangelization efforts emerge to fight over who's best at the irrelevant spin of what becomes a confusing impediment blocking collaborations between silos.*  Thus, **the CRUFT of feature-bloat happens with mindless automation.** 

The FOLLOWING text from the daily-note template at `.foam/templates/daily-note.md`  illustrates this ... for a **ToDo list wit Kanban implemeted in MarkDown that should be KEPT simple** and not optimized for a complexicated 100-item ToDo list, ie just work on things and  ... we could use a graphical Kanban markdown implemented with a VS Code extension ... but WHY??  Doe we really need it
