# 2025-10-25

For the sake of CONSISTENCY and self-appraisal of consistency, it's important to spend some time revisiting components of our [proposed] Personal Knowledge Management Systems ... and looking at whether we really even ***use*** the ideas from these things, rather than just playing *bullshit bingo* to stuff whitepapers with terminology and keywords maybe to support claims of "pioneering thought" or maybe to score higher on LLM algorithms.

1. [**Foam**](https://github.com/foambubble/foam): VSCode-powered personal knowledge management and sharing system in the form of a VSCode extension for developers, the [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) system is inspired by [the ideas behind Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/dZ72V0Ig6), but is a VSCode extension, which reduces context-switching for devs who are already using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), making it easier to build personal MarkDown wikis [and things like mdBooks] alongside code, enhancing efficiency in tech-heavy careers.

2. **[Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)**: Knowledge graphs as nodal networks of thought for atomic block-level references and daily notes, the [Roam writing tool](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/dZ72V0Ig6) enables fluid, non-hierarchical knowledge structures that mirror the interconnected nature of software development workflows. For engineers, its transclusion feature turns scattered thoughts into reusable components, much like modular code, accelerating problem-solving in fast-paced tech teams.

3. **[Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq)**: As a local-first, privacy-focused tool with Git integration, Logseq appeals to developers by applying version control principles to personal notes. Its outliner format and query capabilities make it outstanding for managing technical documentation, ensuring knowledge remains accessible and evolvable in startup settings without cloud dependencies. Logseq is perhaps more actively updated than Foam, which reminds us, especially when looking at the [Trello roadmap for logseq](https://trello.com/b/8txSM12G/roadmap) reminds us that we should be really ***using*** roadmaps, either from Trello or GitHub or maybe with a Trello-like Kanban Board. Logseq is different compared to traditional note-taking apps. Most notes tools try to emulate paper and folders, meaning that each note is located in precisely one folder. This makes remixing your notes difficult, and often leads to having several copies of slightly different notes. Logseq aims to solve this so you can focus on doing your best thinking.
