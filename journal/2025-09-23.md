# 2025-09-23

Today, per our [project outline](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/blob/main/journal/2025-09-23.md), we *are* sort of looking into [GitHub Actions for GH Pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) especially those specifically [intended for mdBook and Rust](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-mdbook-rust) ... *but, frankly, we might be changing direction ever so slightly* ... although we do intend to make EACH one of our 100 PARA Knowledge Areas into a GH Project to follow different favored resources that use AI, such as [Ai2](https://allenai.org/)'s [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/tldr) or [Asta](https://asta.allen.ai/chat/cf03356b-c58d-4bb0-b8b3-54c0b2ad49d2) or [PaperDigest](https://www.paperdigest.org/research/) OR the graph-based approaches like [ConnectedPapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/e48055e54b6c80661d59b6cba16115661e4d3377/Google-Scholar%2C-Web-of-Science%2C-and-Scopus%3A-a-systematic-comparison-of-citations-in-252-subject-categories/graph) or [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/) or [LitMaps](https://www.litmaps.com/)  ... in a well-organized web browser like Zen ... RATHER than aggressively automating with coding assistants and IDEs to roll our own *robo fustercluck*. Let's just say that ***the bloom is off the AI rose a bit, especially in the realm of the AI-ified vibe coding and AI magic powered by coding assistants*** ... we need to spend more time just understanding what's being built and sifting, sorting, organizing.

## It used to known as bait-and-switch and was even illegal, but now it's just the routine future promise-driven hypeware upselling we see with AI 

*The SINGularity is always getting nearer and nearer and ... sing along!*

The following is the kind of hype-driven FOMO marketing that that we've gotten used to ... just like the Arc-derived *Dia browser*, [Comet is another ***AI-powered*** browser](https://www.perplexity.ai/comet) which promises to act as a personal assistant and thinking partner ... offers ***unified*** AI search, instant context, and automation across every site. You can ***stay in the flow*** by asking Comet to manage your email & calendar. Comet will answer questions about your inbox or help follow up on emails, make sense of Slack, social media, and anything on the web ... Comet can book meetings, browse other pages on your behalf, research, shop, summarize, brief you on your day with AI ... and [if you have a Perplexity subscription, it offers] [Perplexity Labs suite of project management tools](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-labs), directly in the browser ... Comet promises to boost your focus, streamline your workflow, and turn curiosity into momentum ... but, as you might expect, Comet is *a bit of a tease* which requires an invitation, you can join the waitlist to be notified EVENTUALLY when access opens up some time in the future ... OR you can [upgrade to Perplexity Pro](https://www.perplexity.ai/pro), or if you are ***really serious,*** *ie a TOTAL SUCKER for FOMO marketing*, and refuse to miss out, you [upgrade to **MAX**](https://www.perplexity.ai/max) ... but why not just just Google Ultra AI Subscription ... *or some other $2500/year subscription*?  ***Why not use them ALL?***

The thing of it is that just spending some time actually investigating the ALTERNATIVES in marketing promises and then maybe trying out some of the most interesting to see whether they really deliver is maybe enough to keep one *entertained*, if not somewhat informed about the state of our culture ... since AI-driven marketing now characterizes how companies present their wares. Not that long ago, ie 10-25 years ago, companies hired evangelists and content producers who produce lengthy whitepapers, YouTube videos, conference talks or in-depth blogs or other forms of semi-valuable content [which one was typically req'd to register for or somehow *pay* to consume] which laid out the strategy and general approach of the product/service.  Now the *Big Sell* or *service before the sale* is delivered by AI. 

Let's consider the case of just exploring the realm of [AI tools for academic research that can coherently summarize vast realms of papers on a topic](https://share.google/aimode/Rvkcp81SpzyAIhfXx) ... such as [Ai2](https://allenai.org/)'s [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/tldr) or [Asta](https://asta.allen.ai/chat/cf03356b-c58d-4bb0-b8b3-54c0b2ad49d2) or [PaperDigest](https://www.paperdigest.org/research/) ... OR [ConnectedPapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/e48055e54b6c80661d59b6cba16115661e4d3377/Google-Scholar%2C-Web-of-Science%2C-and-Scopus%3A-a-systematic-comparison-of-citations-in-252-subject-categories/graph) vs [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/) vs [LitMaps](https://www.litmaps.com/) ... OR [Scite or SciSpace](https://scite.ai/assistant) and [Elicit](https://support.elicit.com/en/articles/553025#is_elicit_restricted_to_open_access_papers_only) ... OR [Consensus](https://consensus.app/) vs [PaperGuide](https://paperguide.ai/) vs [Julius](https://julius.ai/) ...

OR [Yomu AI](https://www.yomu.ai/blog/a-students-guide-to-ai-detection-and-academic-integrity) ... or even the lighter-weight tools like [Scholarcy](https://www.scholarcy.com/scholarcy-features) ...  the *AI singing doesn't stop...*
