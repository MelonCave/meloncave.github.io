We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-10-09.md) to build out Projects, completely RETHINKING P.A.R.A. structured PKE workflows with a today's focus on how the PKM/PKE system can drive [time/resource prioritization and optimization](https://ancientguy.github.io/PKM/2.Areas/11TimeOptimization.html).

## Prioritization Discipline: Sort, Eliminate, Focus On NPV

Don't just do things to stay busy ... prioritize to do the right NPV maximizing things, eliminate the busy work.

### The Value Equation

Prioritization is continuous NPV optimization: weighing implementation costs against returns from Minimum Marketable Features (MMFs)—atomic deliverables customers value enough to justify resource allocation.

**Reality check:** Most work is worthless. Most features won't be valued, won't generate revenue, won't justify their existence. Effective portfolio management is prioritization: identifying and executing the vital few while actively refusing everything else.

Scope management is project management. Prioritization is resource management. Engineers fail by executing brilliantly on irrelevant problems. Success demands elevating standards continuously—acquiring knowledge that drives down costs, eliminates uncertainty, and improves decision-making.

Prioritization is iterative by design. Market conditions shift. Data reveals new insights. Customer needs evolve. Your priorities must evolve with them, enabling successive improvements while ensuring resources flow to maximum-impact activities.

### The Frameworks

#### Pareto Principle: Your Default Operating System

Forget 80/20. Think 95/5: ninety-five percent of outcomes from five percent of inputs.

**The discipline:** Identify the ONE initiative that defines today's success. Complete it. Move to the next ONE. Work your task list, but never sacrifice the critical priority to busyness.

#### MoSCoW: Accelerate Decisions, Eliminate Waste

The prioritization mnemonic that matters:

**Must-have** — Non-negotiable. Critical functionality. The ONE big thing from Pareto.

**Should-have** — Important, but non-essential. Only a secondary priority.

**Could-have** — Nice-to-have. Do ONLY the quick, easy wins. Do NOT invest critical resources.

**Won't-have** — Deferred or dead. WON'T do, somebody else can.

MoSCoW's purpose: rapidly separate what demands execution from everything else.

#### ABC: Cut Through Complexity

Simple ranking: A, B, C.

**A** — Must get done first. Period. No excuses. The Pareto priority.

**B** — Backlog for working on and prioritizing; tackled after A-items are complete.

**C** — Forgotten. Either happens without you or doesn't -- but it doesn't matter to you.

Sub-ranking B-items is permissible (B1, B2, B3) but might just add unnecessary complexity in many contexts ... the A-level things or things that might become A-level are usually obvious enough to spot. The only distinction that matters is to focus on what matters for maximizing NPV ... it's all about getting done that which adds value versus simply staying busy doing things.

#### Eisenhower Matrix: Four Quadrants, One Question

Categorize by urgency and importance:

**Quadrant 1** — Urgent & Important: Do now

**Quadrant 2** — Important, Not Urgent: Schedule

**Quadrant 3** — Urgent, Not Important: Delegate

**Quadrant 4** — Neither: Delete

Ideal for daily task management and straightforward team projects.

####Kano Model: Optimization for Market Leaders

Deploy only when your product already dominates its category. Kano categorizes features by satisfaction impact:

**Basic features** — Expected. Required to compete. Match or exceed category standards.

**Performance features** — Measurable improvements. Linear satisfaction gains.

**Delighters** — Unexpected innovations. Reputation builders.

Combined with NPV analysis, Kano builds competitive moats by establishing feature requirements competitors cannot match.

### Execution Principles

Stack these frameworks as needed for your specific context. Use the simplest possible tools: Trello, spreadsheets, lists. Complexity is the enemy.

Maintain brutal simplicity. Attack scope creep relentlessly. Doing more with less means doing less—but doing what matters.
