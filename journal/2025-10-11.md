We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-10-09.md) to build out Projects, completely RETHINKING P.A.R.A. structured PKE workflows with a today's focus on how the PKM/PKE system can drive [time/resource prioritization and optimization](https://ancientguy.github.io/PKM/2.Areas/11TimeOptimization.html).

Prioritization is a continual process of weighing costs of doing something vs returns or increases in value from doing that thing in a [NPV maximization sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value) -- this involves assessing the cost of delivering a chunk of added functionality vs. the return from that chunk, ie it has a cost, but is the return valued highly enough that customers will pay for it *in some sense* to justify effort. These chunks are atomic deliverables known as Minimum Marketable Features (MMFs) -- when we say *marketable* we mean would customer value this enough to pay or be more likely to sign up for a subscription or somehow give us something in return; the thinking is similar to MVPs or miminally-viable prototypes 

MOST of the things that people work on are NOT worthy of being worked on, NOT worthy of being marketed to some customer, NOT worthy of being created or designed or built or marketed or maintained.  The key to **effective** portfolio management is **prioritization** -- the process of identifying and focusing on the vital few, very most important tasks, or goals that will deliver the highest value or impact ... and not just staying busy, but being more effective, more efficient limiting resources and time to have enough time to prioritize and, in terms of capital, to *keep one's powder dry*.

Scope management is arguably the very most important part of project management, although it's tough or impossible to just tell people NO.  Similarly, prioritization is the most important part of time and resource management ... most engineers fail by working extra hard to develop or implement something that is completely unnecesary. Our prioritization focus is on leveling up, continuously setting the bar higher ... focusing on the kinds of knowledge that will continuously drive down costs, decrease uncertainty or risk, give us better information or more complete knowledge.

Of course, prioritization isn't a one-time event; it has to be iterative and designed into the process to be more or less continuous. As new information emerges—through changing circumstances, data analysis, feedback or other soruces—you refine your choices, leading to successive improvements. Effective prioritization helps allocate limited resources (time, money, energy) to maximize outcomes and minimize waste. Without it, people often fall into "busy work" traps, tackling low-value items while high-impact ones languish.


**The fundamental foundational prioritization structure we use is the Pareto Principle** ... some thing of it as the 80/20 Rule, where 80% of results come from 20% of efforts ... but, actually it be better to think in terms of 95/5, 95% of results come from 5% of efforts ... the key part of this discipline is getting the ONE BIG important thing done, and then then focusing on the next big thing ... one thing at time ... yes, it's important to keep working and attacking the ToDo list, but it's also very important to not get so busy that one ignores the ONE BIG IMPORTANT thing ... so identify the very most vital few 5% that drive 95% of determining whether today is a success; get that ONE BIG THING taken care of first, then work down the ToDo list, working on the remaining one big thing. 

MoSCoW Method, is very similar to the Pareto Principle, in that it uses an the [***moscow*** menomic](https://www.agilebusiness.org/dsdm-project-framework/moscow-prioririsation.html) for **Must-have**, ***Should-have***, Could-have, *Won't-have*. ***Moscow*** has been heavily used by some in agile project management; the distinction between *should* and *could* is best for product backlogs and feature prioritization in software development. **Musts are critical** like the BIG thing we have to focus first on per the Pareto Principle -- the MUSTs are carefully-scoped, highest prioritized chunks of customer-valued functionality ... ***Shoulds*** are important but not as vital as Musts ... Coulds are nice-to-haves, but probably not worth focus in their own right ... Won'ts are deferred or forgotten ... the real goal of MoSCoW is to accelerate the process of recognizing what HAS TO TO BE DONE and eliminating those things that just aren't going to happen. 

ABC Method is simple ranking system where tasks are labeled A (high priority), B (medium), or C (low) ... although it's possible to sub-rank the B categories (e.g., B1, B2, B3, B4, B5) ... it's important to DO the A-thing and forget the C distractions -- the MEANINGFUL distinction is deciding what to DO or what to elevate to A, thus basically involves three categories ... A is the stuff we are absolutely going to get done or die trying, per Pareto principle ... B are all of the different things that are on our list, that we are think about and prioritize, so we can work on them when we have the big stuff done ... C the stuff that are we will forget and will not think about anymore because it's the kind of thing that's just going to need to happen without us .... ABC ideal for quick, simple to-do lists or individual workloads -- it might lacks nuance for complex projects, but it might be best to tell nuance to go screw itself.

The Eisenhower Matrix provides some nuance in a way that keeps it simple is a simple 2x2 grid, best for daily task mgmt and relatively simple team projects, that categorizes tasks by urgency and importance. (1) Urgent & Important (do now), (2) Important but Not Urgent (put off, but schedule), (3) Urgent but Not Important (delegate to someone who cares), (4) Neither (eliminate ASP).

[Kano Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model) is for fine-tuning, optimizing, improving or fiddling with something that has basically proven that it good enough to dominate its category already -- Kano is about sustaining a lead, by categorizing new features or tasks by impact on customer satisfaction: basic or now expected features, especially to match/dominate competing solutions ... performance adders per some linear measure of satisfaction or other measurable improvement ... and delighters or unexpected wow factors, not exactly necessary except in terms of meeting reputation for innovation. NPV thinking, applied per Kano model, drives a focus on ensuring that product defines the must-have features for all products in the category, ie establishing an impossible moat that others can't begin to match.

While the Pareto Principle might dominate our prioritization thinking, all of these different techniques can be habit-stacked and adapted or tailored to specific kinds of projects. Simple tools like Trello or spreadsheets or even simple lists implement the techniques ... in order to do more [with less], it's necessary to keep everything brutually SIMPLE, to continually hammer on scope creep.
