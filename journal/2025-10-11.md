We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-10-09.md) to build out Projects, completely RETHINKING P.A.R.A. structured PKE workflows with a focus on how the PKM/PKE system can drive [time/resource prioritization and optimization](https://ancientguy.github.io/PKM/2.Areas/11TimeOptimization.html).

Prioritization isn't a one-time event; it's iterative. As new information emerges—through feedback, data analysis, or changing circumstances—you refine your choices, leading to successive improvements. Effective prioritization helps allocate limited resources (time, money, energy) to maximize outcomes and minimize waste. Without it, people often fall into "busy work" traps, tackling low-value items while high-impact ones languish.

Different techniques can be habit-stacked and adapted or tailored to specific kinds of projects. Simple tools like Trello, Asana, spreadsheets or even simple lists implement the techniques ... in order to do more [with less], it's necessary to keep everything brutually SIMPLE, to continually hammer on scope creep.

The fundamental foundational structure we use is the Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)... 80% of results come from 20% of efforts ... or actually even 95/5, 95% of results come from 5% of efforts ... the key part of this discipline is getting the ONE BIG important thing done, and then then focusing on the next big thing ... one thing at time ... yes, it's important to keep working and attacking the ToDo list, but it's also very important to not get so busy that one ignores the ONE BIG IMPORTANT thing ... so identify the very most vital few 5% that drive 95% of determining whether today is a success; get that ONE BIG THING taken care of first, then work down the ToDo list, working on the remaining one big thing. 

MoSCoW Method, is very similar to the Pareto Principle, in that it uses an the [***moscow*** menomic](https://www.agilebusiness.org/dsdm-project-framework/moscow-prioririsation.html) for **Must-have**, Should-have, Could-have, *Won't-have*. ***Moscow*** has been heavily used by some in agile project management; the distinction between *should* and *could* is best for product backlogs and feature prioritization in software development. **Musts are critical** like the BIG thing we have to focus first on per the Pareto Principle -- the MUSTs are carefully-scoped, highest prioritized chunks of customer-valued functionality, chunks that are valued enough to pay for *in some sense* are known as Minimum Marketable Features (MMFs); the *must* part is about what customers would pay or give something up for similar to MVPs or miminally-viable prototypes ... Shoulds are important but not as vital as Musts ... Coulds are nice-to-haves, but not worth focus ... Won'ts are deferred or forgotten ... the real goal of MoSCoW is to accelerate the process of recognizing what HAS TO TO BE DONE and eliminating those things that just aren't going to happen. 

ABC Method is simple ranking system where tasks are labeled A (high priority), B (medium), or C (low) ... although it's possible to sub-rank the B categories (e.g., B1, B2, B3, B4, B5) ... it's important to DO the A-thing and forget the C distractions -- the MEANINGFUL distinction is deciding what to DO or what to elevate to A, thus basically involves three categories ... A is the stuff we are absolutely going to get done or die trying, per Pareto principle ... B are all of the different things that are on our list, that we are think about and prioritize, so we can work on them when we have the big stuff done ... C the stuff that are we will forget and will not think about anymore because it's the kind of thing that's just going to need to happen without us .... ABC ideal for quick, simple to-do lists or individual workloads -- it might lacks nuance for complex projects, but it might be best to tell nuance to go screw itself.

The Eisenhower Matrix provides some nuance in a way that keeps it simple is a simple 2x2 grid, best for daily task mgmt and relatively simple team projects, that categorizes tasks by urgency and importance. (1) Urgent & Important (do now), (2) Important but Not Urgent (put off, but schedule), (3) Urgent but Not Important (delegate to someone who cares), (4) Neither (eliminate ASP).

Kano Model is for fine-tuning, optimizing, improving or fiddling with something that is basically good enough already -- it categorizes new features or tasks by impact on customer satisfaction: Basic or now expected, because of competing solutions ... performance (linear satisfaction from a measurable improvement in technical spec ... and Delighters (unexpected wow factors, not really necessary).
