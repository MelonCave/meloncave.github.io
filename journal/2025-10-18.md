We are drawn to exploration of constraints and bottlenecks ... so building upon our previous exploration of [DeepWiki and the realm of DeepWiki-like tools](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_734a8d6f-e1a5-4561-9dd2-e30638866850) ... including the [exploration in a meta sense](https://gemini.google.com/share/322c2df2d6fa) and the deeper, philosophical dives [understanding what code reviews are for, how a tool like DeepWiki works and serves as a transformative tool for getting teams/dev communities up to speed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLZSTZW6uljrjmgILRyWGrA6u1b0_us3sDKqDvub5MI/edit?usp=sharing) ... we want to spend some more time exploring DeepWiki-like tools for the specific purpose of interrogating pre-print archives and making sense of extensive bodies of research and knowledge.
