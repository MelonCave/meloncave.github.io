We are drawn to exploration of constraints and bottlenecks ... so building upon our previous exploration of [DeepWiki and the realm of DeepWiki-like tools](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_734a8d6f-e1a5-4561-9dd2-e30638866850) ... including the [exploration in a meta sense](https://gemini.google.com/share/322c2df2d6fa) and the deeper, philosophical dives [understanding what code reviews are for, how a tool like DeepWiki works and serves as a transformative tool for getting teams/dev communities up to speed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLZSTZW6uljrjmgILRyWGrA6u1b0_us3sDKqDvub5MI/edit?usp=sharing) ... we want to spend some more time exploring DeepWiki-like tools for the specific purpose of interrogating pre-print archives and making sense of extensive bodies of research and knowledge.

In terms of bottlenecks and constraints of knowledge engineering ... I've felt compelled to go back and look at work and life of Paul Dirac ... and his approach to physics, mathematics, and knowledge in general ... but mostly about his foundational intellectual development ... he tried to be a practical electrical engineer first, but when there were no jobs, he pivoted to applied mathematics and the beauty of mathematics in explaining how things works ... which ultimately pushed him to theoretical physics ... because theoretical physics was the most profoundly practiccal knowledge possible ... far more practical being an electrician or technician or electrical engineering ... because of how quantum mechanics explains how/why things work as they do. 

The real POINT of the Dirac biography, intellectual development, history of the field of quantum mechanics is entirely about PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING ... how does one go about learning and mastering a complex body of knowledge ... and how does one go about pushing the boundaries of knowledge in a field that is already well established ... and how does one go about making sense of the existing body of knowledge to find gaps, inconsistencies, and opportunities for new insights.
