# Outline for Simple, Sacrificial Interlocked Concrete Faux-Boulder Flood Wall

As we think about scaffolding of a personal knowledge management system ... and the way that the structure must resist or ideally accommodate and even use different external pressures ... it's not a structure that must be perfect or must resist ALL pressures, but it should be significant enough for the scope of the project ... we might want to think about [the overview](https://gemini.google.com/share/02047fafa11a) how we would build a 10-14 ft flood wall that can resist a 6-8 ft muddy surge, using interlocking concrete blocks with a faux-boulder appearance. 

It should be emphasized that this structure is NOT about a flood wall that would resist anything, such as 2500-year or 5000-year floods -- it's basically a matter of offering protection against the most significant flood likely to be seen in 100 or even maybe 500 years. Similarly, our PKM system matters a lot to us, but it is PERSONAL, for things like staying abreast of trends in one's profession, investments or particular interests ... a PKM is not something that is enterprise-grade or necessary for a state or nation, but the structure of how we think about managing knowledge should be robust enough to handle the expected loads of our daily knowledge work.

Below is a somewhat detailed outline that captures the key considerations, design elements, and construction steps for beginning to think about such a project.

**Key Points**  
- Use large interlocking precast concrete blocks (e.g., Redi-Rock or similar PMB systems) with natural stone textures for a faux-boulder appearance; these 1-2 ton blocks interlock via knobs/grooves and can be steel-reinforced for stability.  
- Design as a gravity or hybrid freestanding wall 10-14 ft tall (6-8 ft water + 3-5 ft freeboard + embedment) to resist initial muddy surge via mass and deep embedment; allow overtopping or partial failure in extreme events without catastrophic collapse—it seems likely that this sacrificial approach balances cost and performance for non-1000-year floods.  
- Incorporate steel rebar in block cores + concrete infill for reinforcement; deep footings (concrete leveling pad or keyed footing embedded 4-6+ ft below anticipated scour) provide overturning/sliding resistance and scour protection.  
- Critical: robust drainage (weep holes, perforated pipe, gravel blanket) to relieve hydrostatic pressure; evidence leans toward failure from poor drainage more than surge alone.  
- Hire a licensed geotechnical/structural engineer for site-specific design—DIY risks collapse; controversy exists around unengineered block walls in flood zones, but properly designed PMB systems have proven effective in real surges.

**Overview**  
This plan creates a steel-reinforced, interlocking concrete faux-boulder retaining/flood wall that resists a 6-8 ft muddy surge through gravity mass, deep embedment, and targeted reinforcement while remaining sacrificial (rebuildable after extreme overtopping). Systems like Redi-Rock Limestone/Cobblestone blocks deliver the aesthetic and perform in documented flood events. Total cost typically 30-50% less than cast-in-place concrete for similar heights; rebuild after sacrifice feasible by replacing damaged blocks.

**Design Targets**  
- **Height**: 10-14 ft exposed (8-10 ft effective water resistance + freeboard/embedment).  
- **Loads**: Hydrostatic (γ_w h²/2 ≈ 62.4 × 8² / 2 = 2 ksf at base), surge impact (Minikin method for breaking waves), muddy debris (add 50-100% momentary load).  
- **Safety Factors** (USACE): Overturning ≥1.5, sliding ≥1.5, bearing ≥3.0 (usual conditions).  
- **Scour Protection**: Embed 4-6 ft below predicted local + general scour (use HEC-RAS or Lacey equation).  

**Quick Cost & Timeline**  
- Materials/labor: $150-300 per sq ft face (2025 pricing).  
- Build time: 2-4 weeks for 100 ft run with crane + 4-person crew.

### Comprehensive Survey Note on Constructing a Sacrificial Interlocked Concrete Faux-Boulder Flood Wall

This detailed annotated outline functions as a professional engineering roadmap for a gravity/hybrid retaining wall using large (1-2 ton) precast modular blocks (PMBs) with faux-boulder textures. The design prioritizes resisting the initial 6-8 ft muddy surge via mass, steel reinforcement, and deep embedment while permitting controlled overtopping or segmental failure in >100-year events—making it sacrificial and rebuildable. Primary system referenced: Redi-Rock (Limestone or Cobblestone texture) or equivalents (Inter-Block Enviro-Block, VERSA-LOK Brute). All steps assume coordination with a licensed geotechnical and structural engineer; local codes may require stamped plans.

# **Design, Analysis, and Construction of a Sacrificial, Reinforced Precast Modular Block (PMB) Flood Wall**

---

## **Executive Summary & Project Mandate**

This report provides the comprehensive engineering basis for the design and construction of a 10- to 14-foot-tall, freestanding, sacrificial flood wall. The proposed system utilizes large, wet-cast Precast Modular Blocks (PMBs) with natural stone texturing (e.g., Redi-Rock Limestone/Cobblestone). The core design philosophy deviates from traditional monolithic, "fail-proof" cast-in-place (CIP) concrete and instead leverages the PMB system's inherent modularity.

The design objective is threefold:

1. **Resist Design Loads:** The wall must remain structurally sound and stable against the design flood (e.g., a 100-year event resulting in a 6-8 ft muddy surge) through a combination of gravity mass, deep scour-resistant footings, and internal steel reinforcement.  
2. **Provide Sacrificial Contingency:** For extreme events exceeding the design flood (e.g., \>100-year), the wall is designed to permit controlled overtopping or segmental failure *without* catastrophic, progressive collapse of the entire structure.  
3. **Ensure Rapid, Cost-Effective Repair:** Post-event serviceability is a primary driver. The design ensures that after an extreme event, the wall can be rapidly repaired by re-stacking damaged or dislodged modular units on the intact, deep-embedment foundation.

This methodology, which balances performance and lifecycle cost, is validated by documented performance data from PMB structures in extreme hydraulic events. Notably, Redi-Rock detention walls in Houston, Texas, successfully withstood "extreme drawdown" and "fully saturated soil" conditions during Hurricane Harvey, performing "perfectly". The entire design, analysis, and construction process detailed herein is grounded in the hydraulic structure standards of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), specifically **EM 1110-2-2502, *Floodwalls and Other Hydraulic Retaining Walls***, and the new flood load requirements stipulated in **ASCE 24-24, *Flood Resistant Design and Construction***.

## **I. Pre-Design & Site Assessment**

The viability of the entire structure is contingent upon a rigorous upfront analysis of the site's specific hydraulic and geotechnical conditions. An inadequate site assessment is a primary contributor to hydraulic structure failure.

### **1\. Hydrologic & Hydraulic (H\&H) Study**

The baseline for the H\&H study begins with the effective Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) to determine the 100-year Base Flood Elevation (BFE). However, modern engineering standards require a more comprehensive analysis.

The design must adhere to the new **ASCE 24-24 standard**, which supersedes the 2014 edition. This new standard fundamentally redefines the flood hazard area. As noted by the Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM), ASCE 24-24 now expands the regulated hazard area to include the **500-year floodplain** (often mapped as Shaded X Zone). It also ties the required Design Flood Elevation (DFE) to the structure's "Flood Design Class," which for most commercial or public structures will be Class II, corresponding to the 500-year mean recurrence interval (MRI) flood event.

This code update directly supports the proposed "sacrificial" design philosophy. The H\&H study must therefore use a 1D or 2D hydraulic model, such as the USACE HEC-RAS (River Analysis System), to analyze two distinct scenarios:

1. **Design Flood (100-year Event):** This scenario establishes the minimum design loads. The wall must remain stable and meet all USACE factors of safety (see Section III) under the 100-year BFE plus a 3-foot freeboard (a USACE urban standard). This event will define the primary hydrostatic, hydrodynamic, and wave loads.  
2. **Extreme Event (500-year Event):** This scenario models the "sacrificial" overtopping condition. The model will determine the *depth of overtopping*, the *flow velocity* of the water passing over the wall, and the *duration* of the overtopping. This data is not for stability analysis but is critical for designing the landward erosion protection (e.g., riprap apron) and ensuring the overtopping is controlled and non-catastrophic.

### **2\. Geotechnical Investigation**

A comprehensive geotechnical investigation is mandatory. A minimum of three soil borings, advanced to a depth of 1.5 to 2.0 times the total wall height (i.e., 20-28 ft for a 14-ft wall), is required.

Standard Penetration Tests (SPTs) and the recovery of undisturbed soil samples for laboratory analysis are required to determine the engineering properties of the foundation and backfill soils. These parameters are not arbitrary; they are the direct inputs for the USACE stability calculations detailed in Section III:

* **Friction Angle ($\\phi'$) and Cohesion ($c'$):** These parameters define the shear strength of the soil, which is used to calculate sliding resistance and bearing capacity.  
* **Saturated Unit Weight ($\\gamma\_{sat}$):** This is required to calculate the resisting forces from the soil mass and the driving forces under rapid drawdown conditions.1

The investigation must also determine the depth to the seasonal high groundwater table, the local frost depth, and, critically, the **liquefaction susceptibility** of the foundation soils. Flood walls in alluvial valleys are "particularly likely" to be situated over loose, saturated sands that may liquefy during a seismic event. A liquefaction analysis (e.g., per Seed & Idriss) is required, as the joint probability of an earthquake during a flood, while low, has exceptionally high consequences.

### **3\. Scour Analysis: A Critical Distinction**

The outline correctly identifies scour as a primary failure vector. However, the methodology for analyzing scour at a continuous flood wall is distinct from the common equations referenced for bridge scour.

The HEC-RAS scour module, the Lacey equation, and the CSU equation are all components of the **HEC-18 *Evaluating Scour at Bridges*** manual. These equations are specifically formulated to predict *local scour at bridge piers and abutments*. This type of scour is driven by the formation of a *horseshoe vortex* as flow is obstructed by a discrete, blunt-nosed object (a pier) and accelerates around it.

A continuous flood wall is *not* a discrete object. It functions as a *channel constriction* and a *continuous vertical flow boundary*. Scour at the toe of a vertical wall is driven by different, and often more complex, mechanisms:

* General channel-bed degradation from long-term trends.  
* **Contraction Scour:** The acceleration of flow as the entire channel cross-section is narrowed by the wall.  
* **Local Scour:** Driven by flow separation, turbulence, and vortices generated at the continuous toe of the wall, as well as localized orbital velocities from reflected wave energy.

Therefore, the HEC-18 *scour module* is an inappropriate tool. The correct, modern engineering approach is as follows:

1. Use the **HEC-RAS 1D/2D model** (from the H\&H study) to determine the *hydraulic parameters* (flow velocity $V$ and depth $y$) at the proposed wall toe during the 100-year and 500-year events.  
2. Apply these hydraulic parameters to the specific guidance for **"Scour and erosion of walls,"** a new section added in the **2022 USACE EM 1110-2-2502 update**.  
3. The *total scour depth* (the sum of long-term degradation, contraction scour, and local toe scour) will be calculated. The outline's estimate of 4-6 ft is a reasonable preliminary assumption.  
4. This calculated total scour depth, plus a minimum 2-foot safety factor, determines the **minimum embedment depth** for the *bottom* of the wall foundation.

### **4\. Survey & Utilities**

A detailed topographic survey is required to establish existing grades, benchmarks, and property lines. All existing surface and subsurface utilities must be located and marked (e.g., "call before you dig"). Any utilities that conflict with the wall's deep foundation must be relocated *prior* to excavation.

## **II. Engineering Principles & System Selection**

The selection of a PMB system is a deliberate engineering decision based on a higher standard of care required for hydraulic structures.

### **1\. The USACE Distinction: "Flood Wall" vs. "Retaining Wall"**

This project must be engineered to a higher standard than a typical landscaping or highway retaining wall. The USACE EM 1110-2-2502 provides the critical, legal, and engineering distinction:

* **Retaining Wall:** A wall that "restrains material to maintain a difference in elevation". Its primary loads are static (or seismic) soil pressures. The USACE notes that the "consequences of failure... are often lower".  
* **Flood Wall:** A wall whose "principal function \[is\] the prevention of flooding". It is designed to resist *hydraulic loads*, including static water, flowing water (hydrodynamic), wave action, and spray.

This distinction is the single most important concept in the design. The USACE states: **"The consequences of failure for a flood wall are normally very great since it protects valuable property and human life"**. Because the consequences are high, the "design... must be executed in a logical, conservative manner based on the function of the wall and the consequences of failure".

This mandate for a conservative, logical design requires the application of higher factors of safety and a rigorous, formula-based analysis of specific hydraulic failure modes (scour, seepage, overtopping, rapid drawdown) that are not the primary concern for a simple retaining wall.

Any "controversy around unengineered block walls in flood zones" is therefore irrelevant. This will *not* be an "unengineered" or "landscaping" wall. It will be a Precast Modular Block system *designed, analyzed, and constructed as a formal Flood Wall* per the governing USACE and ASCE standards.

### **2\. System Trade-Off Analysis: PMB vs. Cast-in-Place (CIP) Concrete**

The "sacrificial" design is predicated on using a modular PMB system. This choice is deliberate and based on a full lifecycle cost-benefit analysis (LCCA), which evaluates total cost of ownership from acquisition to disposal.

A monolithic CIP wall is designed to *never* fail; if it does, the failure is brittle, catastrophic, and total. A PMB wall is designed to be *resilient* and *repairable*. The advantages of the PMB system are summarized below.

**Table 1: Lifecycle Comparison — Sacrificial PMB vs. Monolithic CIP Flood Wall**

| Metric | Sacrificial PMB System (This Design) | Monolithic Cast-in-Place (CIP) Wall |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Initial Cost** | **Lower.** Reports indicate 30-50% less than CIP for similar heights. | **High.**. |
| **Installation Speed** | **Fast (2-4 Weeks).** Blocks are crane-set. No on-site formwork or cure time. | **Slow (8-12+ Weeks).** Requires extensive formwork, rebar tying, and 28-day cure time. |
| **Design Philosophy** | **"Sacrificial" & Segmental.** Designed to permit controlled overtopping and modular, non-progressive failure. | **"Monolithic" & Brittle.** Designed to *never* fail. If it does, failure is catastrophic. |
| **Failure Mode** | Controlled overtopping. Localized block dislodgement or shifting, constrained by internal rebar. | Brittle fracture (large structural crack), catastrophic overturning, or sliding failure of the entire monolith. |
| **Post-Event Repair** | **Modular & Fast.** Damaged/dislodged blocks are crane-lifted and re-stacked on the intact foundation. | **Total Demolition.** A cracked or undermined monolithic wall cannot be "repaired"; it must be fully demolished and rebuilt. |
| **Est. Repair Cost** | **Low.** Cost to replace individual blocks (est. $15-$55/sq ft). | **Extreme.** Full demolition (est. $10-$20/linear ft) *plus* full replacement (est. $70-$125/linear ft or more). |

### **3\. PMB System Specification: Redi-Rock vs. Alternatives**

Given the 10-14 ft height and the hybrid (gravity \+ reinforced) design, the specific PMB system is a critical engineering choice.

* **Redi-Rock (Basis of Design):** This is a wet-cast concrete system, specified to a high strength (e.g., 4,000+ psi). The blocks are massive, ranging from 1,400 to 4,800 lbs.  
  * **Interlock:** Utilizes a patented "knob and groove" system, providing a positive shear key between courses.2  
  * **Reinforcement:** Redi-Rock offers **Freestanding Hollow-Core (F-HC) blocks**. This is the key technology enabling this design. The F-HC blocks feature "convenient rebar grooves" and a large central cavity that can be "reinforced and filled with poured-in-place concrete". This creates a unified, internally reinforced structure.  
* **Inter-Block / Enviro-Block (Alternative 1):** This is also a massive block system, with weights over 3,900 lbs.  
  * **Interlock:** Uses a 4-inch high "male key" at the top of the block.3  
  * **Reinforcement:** The system includes "cast-in reinforcing ducts at 600mm centres", providing a similar capability to the Redi-Rock F-HC.  
  * **Primary Concern:** This system is often manufactured with "return concrete," meaning the concrete strength "will vary". A guaranteed, high-strength mix (e.g., 4,000 psi) must be specified at an extra charge. This introduces a significant Quality Control (QC) risk for a high-consequence flood wall.  
* **VERSA-LOK Brute (Alternative 2):** This is a smaller, 240-lb block.  
  * **Interlock:** Uses a *top-pinning* design (nylon or fiberglass pins) to connect courses.  
  * **Reinforcement:** This system is not designed for internal steel reinforcement; it relies on geogrid.  
  * **Conclusion:** The manufacturer and other sources note that Brute is an "ideal solid solution for *unreinforced* walls to 8 feet" or for DIY/residential projects. It is *not* suitable for the 14-foot, internally reinforced, high-consequence hydraulic structure required for this project.

**Decision:** The **Redi-Rock Freestanding Hollow-Core (F-HC) system** is the specified Basis of Design. This is due to its proven hollow-core reinforcement system, its manufacture from high-strength (4,000+ psi) wet-cast concrete, and its documented performance in flood and water applications.

## **III. Load & Stability Analysis (The Engineering Core)**

This section details the specific loads applied to the wall, superseding empirical rules-of-thumb with modern, code-based engineering formulas. The wall, as a complete system including its foundation, must be stable against sliding (Factor of Safety, FS $\\geq 1.5$), overturning (FS $\\geq 1.5$), and bearing capacity failure (FS $\\geq 3.0$) under all combined load cases.

### **1\. Load Case 1: Hydrostatic Load (Muddy Surge)**

The outline's baseline calculation ($\\gamma\_w h^2/2$) is for *clear water* ($\\gamma\_w \\approx 62.4$ pcf). This is unconservative and incorrect for a "muddy surge."

A "muddy surge" is a sediment-laden fluid, or turbidity current. This fluid is denser than clear water. In geotechnical and petroleum engineering, this is modeled as a fluid with a higher *equivalent mud weight* or *Equivalent Fluid Density (EFD)*. A typical drilling mud, for example, may range from 9.0 to 11.0 pounds per gallon (ppg), whereas clear water is $\\approx 8.3$ ppg.

**Design Requirement:** All hydrostatic calculations for the "muddy surge" scenario will use an EFD of **$\\gamma\_{mud} \= 75.0$ pcf**. This is a 20% increase over the clear-water density and is a defensible, quantifiable engineering value.

* **Clear Water Pressure (Baseline):** $p\_{water} \= 62.4 \\text{ pcf} \\times 8 \\text{ ft} \= 499 \\text{ psf}$  
* **Muddy Surge Pressure (Design):** $p\_{mud} \= 75.0 \\text{ pcf} \\times 8 \\text{ ft} \= 600 \\text{ psf}$  
* **Total Force (Muddy Surge):** $P\_{mud} \= 0.5 \\times \\gamma\_{mud} \\times h^2 \= 0.5 \\times 75.0 \\times 8^2 \= 2,400 \\text{ lbs/ft}$

This 2,400 lbs/ft force (a 20% increase) provides a rational basis for the outline's intuition to "add 50-100% momentary load," but does so using a repeatable, first-principles calculation.

### **2\. Load Case 2: Surge Impact (Breaking Waves)**

The outline references the Minikin method. This is an obsolete standard and will be replaced to comply with modern engineering practice.

The USACE *Shore Protection Manual* (SPM 1984\) included the Minikin method. However, the USACE *Coastal Engineering Manual* (CEM), which *supersedes* the SPM, **does not include the Minikin method**.

The reason for this change is that the Minikin method is now deemed "overly conservative". It was found to produce force estimates "as high as 15 to 18 times those calculated for non-breaking waves" and is now considered to be of "historical interest".

**Design Requirement:** The modern, preferred method, which is also adopted by ASCE 7-22, is the **Goda method**. Goda's method is superior because it (a) is applicable to both breaking and non-breaking waves, (b) provides a simple trapezoidal pressure distribution for easy calculation, and (c) has been validated by extensive large-scale data.

The wall will be designed to resist the pressure profile defined by Goda's equations:

* Maximum pressure at Still Water Level (SWL): $p\_1 \= 0.5 (1 \+ \\cos\\beta) (\\alpha\_1 \+ \\alpha\_2 \\cos^2\\beta) \\gamma H\_{max}$  
* Pressure at wall base: $p\_3 \= \\alpha\_3 p\_1$  
* Height of pressure profile above SWL: $\\eta^\* \= 0.75 (1 \+ \\cos\\beta) H\_{max}$

Where $\\alpha\_1$, $\\alpha\_2$, and $\\alpha\_3$ are empirical coefficients derived from Goda's charts based on water depth and wave period, $\\beta$ is the angle of wave approach, and $H\_{max}$ is the design wave height from the H\&H study.

### **3\. Load Case 3: Debris Impact Load**

The outline suggests an empirical "50-100% momentary load" for debris. This will be replaced with the specific, formulaic standard mandated by ASCE 7-22.

**Design Requirement:** Per **ASCE 7-22 Supplement 2, Section 5.4.5, Equation 5.4-20**, the Elastic Debris Impact Load ($F\_{di}$) will be calculated. This method, patterned after tsunami load provisions, provides a rational, physics-based load.

The formula is:  
$F\_{di} \= C\_o \\cdot V \\cdot C\_R \\cdot C\_s \\cdot \\sqrt{k\_e \\cdot m\_{debris}}$  
The variables are defined by ASCE 7-22 and FEMA P-2345:

* $F\_{di}$ \= Debris impact force (lbs).  
* $C\_o$ \= Debris orientation coefficient. Taken as **0.80**.  
* $V$ \= Design flood velocity (ft/s) from the HEC-RAS model (e.g., 7.2 ft/s per S260).  
* $C\_R$ \= Debris depth coefficient. For design flood depths greater than 5 ft (our 8-ft surge), $C\_R$ \= **1.0**.  
* $C\_s$ \= Debris velocity stagnation coefficient. Taken as **1.0**.  
* $k\_e$ \= Elastic stiffness of the debris. Per FEMA guidance, a 1,000-lb log (a common design debris object) has $k\_e$ \= **4,200,000 lb/ft**.4  
* $m\_{debris}$ \= Mass of the debris. For a 1,000-lb log, $m \= W/g \= 1,000 \\text{ lbs} / 32.2 \\text{ ft/s}^2$ \= **31.1 slug** (or $\\text{lb-s}^2/\\text{ft}$).

This formula provides a computable, high-magnitude, short-duration load that is required by the current standard and replaces the previous guesswork.

### **4\. Load Case 4: Rapid Drawdown**

This is a critical load case for any flood wall and a common cause of failure. The scenario occurs when the exterior floodwater recedes quickly ("drawdown"), removing the stabilizing exterior water load, while the backfill remains "fully saturated".

This load case is where the drainage system (Section V) becomes a primary structural component.

* **If Drainage Fails:** The system becomes clogged with mud, and the full hydrostatic head of the trapped 8-ft muddy surge ($\\gamma\_{mud} \= 75.0$ pcf) is now *pushing the wall from the land side*.  
* **If Drainage Succeeds:** The hydrostatic pressure is relieved, and the wall only has to resist the *saturated soil* weight ($\\gamma\_{sat}$) and active earth pressure.

The design will be checked for stability under the worst-case (failed drainage) scenario. The documented performance of the Redi-Rock wall at Lumpkin Road in "extreme drawdown" validates that an engineered PMB system *can* be designed to withstand this critical load case, which is the most common cause of retaining structure failure.

## **IV. Foundation & Scour Protection Design**

The "sacrificial" design applies only to the wall *stem*. The foundation is designed as a *permanent, resilient* component intended to survive the "sacrificial" event and serve as the base for rapid repair.

### **1\. Foundation Design: Deep-Embedment Keyed Footing**

The foundation must be embedded *below* the total scour depth identified in the Section I-3 analysis (e.g., 6-10 ft below grade).

* **Type:** The footing will be a continuous, reinforced concrete T-wall or L-wall base (3,000+ psi concrete).1  
* **Shear Key:** A concrete **shear key** (12-inch x 12-inch minimum) will be designed, projecting from the bottom of the footing.1 The shear key is a critical component for sliding resistance. It forces the potential failure plane *deeper* into the native soil, mobilizing the *passive earth pressure* of the soil wedge in front of the key. This provides a much larger resistance to sliding (increasing the FS $\\geq 1.5$) than simple base friction ($\\tan\\phi$) alone.  
* **Width:** The footing width (toe-to-heel) will be approximately 0.7 to 1.0 times the exposed wall height (e.g., 10-14 ft wide). The final width will be engineered to ensure the resultant of all forces (from the load cases in Sec. III) falls within the **middle 1/3** of the base. This ensures the foundation is 100% in compression under normal loads 1, prevents uplift at the heel, and satisfies the required factors of safety for overturning (FS $\\geq 1.5$) and bearing capacity (FS $\\geq 3.0$).

### **2\. Scour Protection: The Active Apron**

Deep embedment is passive protection. The design must also include *active* scour protection at the toe, as recommended by USACE for bank protection.

**Design Requirement:** A **launchable stone apron** (riprap) will be designed and placed at the *toe* (flood side) of the wall.

This system functions as a self-healing scour countermeasure:

1. The HEC-RAS model (Sec. I-3) provides the design velocity $V$ at the wall toe.  
2. Using USACE **EM 1110-2-1601** (Hydraulic Design of Flood Control Channels), this velocity $V$ is used to calculate the *required median size* (D50) of stable stone riprap that will resist erosion.  
3. This heavy, sized riprap is placed in a thick, wide "apron" at the base of the wall.  
4. When the "extreme event" (500-year) flood occurs, the high-velocity flow *will* cause local scour at the toe.  
5. As the scour hole begins to form, the "launchable" riprap at the edge of the apron *falls into the hole*, armoring the bed.  
6. This process, known as *self-launching*, arrests the scour *before* it can progress, protecting the soil *above* the deep footing.

This combination of (1) deep footing embedment (passive) and (2) a self-launching scour apron (active) provides the robust, multi-layered protection required. It ensures the *foundation* survives the "sacrificial" event, making the re-stacking of blocks feasible. USACE EM 1110-2-2502 notes this potential for scour can require rigid paving in a 20- to 30-foot area, a function this riprap apron will serve.

## **V. Drainage & Seepage Control (The Critical System)**

This is the single most critical system for wall survival. Forensic studies of retaining wall failures, such as those cited by USACE and in geotechnical journals, confirm that **"improper design of the drainage system... is the main cause of retaining wall failure"** and **"poor drainage is by far the most common cause of poor performance"**. Our design must aggressively and redundantly manage hydrostatic pressure to prevent the rapid drawdown failure (Sec. III-4).

### **1\. Primary System: Geotextile & Gravel Blanket**

A 12-inch-thick vertical gravel chimney (using clean, free-draining ASTM No. 57 crushed stone) will be placed directly behind the blocks, extending from the footing to the cap. This chimney is separated from the *native* soil backfill by a non-woven geotextile filter fabric.

The selection of this fabric is an *engineered* task, not a commodity choice. This is to prevent the "mud clogging" failure mode.

1. The "muddy surge" (Sec. III-1) will introduce fine-grained silts and clays into the backfill.  
2. The geotextile's function is to let water *out* of the soil and into the gravel drain, while keeping soil particles *in*.  
3. If the geotextile has an **Apparent Opening Size (AOS)** that is *too small*, these fine particles will quickly *clog* the fabric pores, forming a "filter cake" and turning the fabric into an impermeable barrier.  
4. This clogging is the *primary mechanism* that enables the catastrophic "rapid drawdown" failure, trapping the 8-ft hydrostatic head behind the wall.

**Design Requirement (AOS):** The geotextile (e.g., non-woven 8 oz/yd²) will be specified per ASTM D4751 and filtration criteria. It must have a *maximum* AOS to ensure particle retention (e.g., $AOS \\leq B \\cdot D\_{85(\\text{soil})}$) but also a *minimum* permittivity (water flow rate) to ensure high flow, even when exposed to suspended solids.

### **2\. Collection System: Toe Drain & Cleanouts**

All water from the gravel blanket funnels to a 6- to 8-inch-diameter perforated 5 sock drain pipe at the base of the wall. The design of this drain is explicitly mandated by USACE.

**Design Requirement (per USACE EM 1110-2-2502):**

1. **Placement:** The toe drain shall **"never be located under the wall footing"**.5 It will be placed on the landward side, *outside* the heel of the foundation. This placement is required to **"allow maintenance access and to avoid crushing the drain"**.5  
2. **Maintenance:** The system *must* be maintainable. We will incorporate vertical **cleanout ports** that run from the toe drain to the surface. Per USACE EM 1110-2-2502, these access points must be placed at "changes in alignment" and at "intervals not to exceed 500 feet". This design will specify a more conservative 75-100 ft interval.  
3. **Discharge:** The drain will daylight to a gravity outlet every 50-75 ft. All discharge pipes will be fitted with check valves to prevent backflow and tailwater from entering the drain system.

### **3\. Secondary System: Weepholes**

As a redundant pressure relief mechanism, 3-inch-diameter PVC weepholes will be placed at 8 ft on-center.1 They will be located in the first course of blocks above the foundation, just above the toe drain.

**Design Requirement (Pest Control):** All weephole openings will be fitted with **stainless steel screens** (with 1.6mm or smaller punched holes) or heavy-gauge metal mesh. This is a critical maintenance feature to prevent rodents and insects from nesting in the gravel chimney. Such nests can clog the drainage system from the inside, compromising the entire wall.

## **VI. Structural & Reinforcement Detailing**

The wall's ability to act as a hybrid (gravity/cantilever) system and fail segmentally depends on the reinforcement.

### **1\. System Specification**

The wall stem will be constructed using **Redi-Rock 41-inch or 60-inch Freestanding Hollow-Core (F-HC) Blocks**.

### **2\. Vertical Reinforcement (The "Spine")**

Vertical **\#6 to \#9 Grade 60 rebar** will be doweled into the concrete foundation. This rebar will be placed in the aligned hollow cores of the stacked blocks and run continuously to the top of the wall.

This rebar cage is the "spine" of the wall. It transforms the "stack of blocks" into a series of *ductile concrete columns*. This reinforcement provides the *ductility* 1 and *flexural strength* required to resist the bending moments from the hydrostatic 1, wave, and debris impact loads. This internal spine is what prevents a brittle, unreinforced gravity failure.

### **3\. Grout Infill**

The hollow cores containing the rebar will be fully grouted with **4,000 psi concrete** as each course is placed. This grout bonds the rebar to the blocks, ensuring the entire system acts as a composite, *monolithic stem* that is fully anchored to the deep foundation.

### **4\. Geogrid (Deliberate Omission)**

Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) walls use geogrid 3 as their primary reinforcement. The outline correctly notes that geogrid is an option but should be *minimized*.

This design *deliberately omits* geogrid as a primary reinforcement. Geogrid is expensive and *cannot be repaired* after an overtopping event. A flood that overtops the wall and scours the *backfill* would destroy the geogrid, requiring 100% excavation and replacement of the entire reinforced soil mass.

By using the *internally reinforced F-HC blocks*, the design achieves its target 10-14 ft height and stability *without* relying on expensive, non-serviceable geogrid. This is a fundamental decision that enables the "sacrificial, rebuildable" design philosophy.

## **VII. Construction & Erection Plan**

The speed of PMB installation is a major project advantage, but it demands high precision at critical steps. The 2-4 week timeline for a 100-ft run (per the outline) is feasible with a 4-person crew and a crane.

### **1\. Foundation & Leveling Pad (The Critical Path)**

The foundation is the most critical component.

1. Excavate to the full scour/frost depth (e.g., 6-10 ft) as determined by the geotechnical and scour reports (Sec. I).  
2. Pour the reinforced concrete keyed footing (Sec. IV-1) and allow for a 7-day minimum cure.  
3. Place a 12-inch-thick compacted layer of dense-graded aggregate (e.g., crushed stone) for the leveling pad.

**QC Hold Point:** This leveling pad is the most critical tolerance in the project. It *must* be leveled to **$\\pm 1/8$ inch over 10 feet**. Any imperfection, settlement, or "hump" in this pad will telegraph up the entire 14-ft wall, creating gaps, compromising the knob/groove interlock, and inducing dangerous point-stresses on the blocks.

### **2\. Wall Erection & Backfill Sequence**

The wall is *not* built first and then backfilled. It is a concurrent, lift-by-lift process.

**Sequence (per lift):**

1. **Stack:** A crane or large excavator sets one course of Redi-Rock blocks in a running bond, ensuring the knobs lock securely into the grooves of the course below.  
2. **Reinforce:** Place the next section of vertical rebar (spliced as needed) through the F-HC cores and fill the cores with 4,000 psi grout.  
3. **Drainage:** On the landward side, place the 12" gravel chimney (ASTM No. 57 stone).1  
4. **Filter:** Place the geotextile filter fabric (specified in Sec. V-1).  
5. **Backfill:** Place structural fill (e.g., GW/GP soils) in 9-inch lifts.  
6. **Compact:** Compact the backfill to **95% Standard Proctor (ASTM D1557)**.

**Critical QC Note:** *No heavy (e.g., full-size dozer or vibratory roller) equipment is allowed within 3 feet of the wall face*. This zone must be compacted with light, walk-behind vibrating plates. Using heavy equipment too close to the wall can push it out of alignment or, worse, generate lateral earth pressures *exceeding* the active design values, leading to failure.

## **VIII. Regulatory & Permitting Compliance**

The wall's location in a flood-prone area 1 and likely a designated **Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)** makes regulatory compliance a primary design driver.

### **1\. FEMA NFIP "No-Rise" Certification**

If the wall is located within a *Regulatory Floodway* (the high-velocity channel of the floodplain), NFIP regulation 44 CFR 60.3(d)(3) applies. This regulation prohibits any encroachment that would "result in any increase in flood levels."

**Design Requirement:** We *must* provide a **"No-Rise Certification"** to the local floodplain administrator. This certification is not a simple letter; it is a full hydraulic modeling report.6

Our Technical Submission (per FEMA guidelines 6):

1. **Effective Model:** We will obtain the official FEMA HEC-RAS (or other step-backwater) model that was used to create the FIRM. We will run this model to establish the "Effective" or "Baseline" BFE.  
2. **Proposed Model:** We will modify the model's geometric data to include our 10-14 ft flood wall as a solid obstruction.  
3. **Comparison:** We will run the "Proposed" model and compare its BFE output to the "Effective" model at all cross-sections.  
4. **Certification:** Provided the model shows *no increase* (or \<1.0 ft, jurisdiction-dependent) in the upstream BFE, this HEC-RAS data will be stamped by a licensed P.E. and submitted as the "supporting technical data" 6 for the No-Rise Certification.

If an unavoidable increase *is* found, the project must be halted and a **Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)** must be filed with FEMA, which is a complex, costly, and time-consuming public process.

### **2\. ASCE 24-24 Compliance**

The project will be designed to meet or exceed all requirements of **ASCE 24-24: *Flood Resistant Design and Construction***. This includes:

* Using flood-damage-resistant materials (wet-cast concrete, galvanized/epoxy-coated steel).  
* Meeting the new DFE requirements based on the 500-year floodplain analysis.  
* Applying the correct flood load combinations (e.g., hydrostatic, hydrodynamic, debris).  
* Ensuring all backfill and structural fill is properly compacted and stable under conditions of inundation and rapid drawdown.

## **IX. Post-Event Contingency & Lifecycle Analysis (The "Sacrificial" Plan)**

The core economic and resilience argument for this design is realized *after* an extreme event.

### **1\. "Sacrificial" Design Philosophy**

The term "sacrificial" is used here in the same way FEMA uses "breakaway wall" or "wet floodproofing". It is a component *designed to yield* in a controlled way to protect the primary structure and human life.

In this system:

* **Resilient (Permanent) Components:** The deep-embedment keyed footing (Sec. IV) and the internal rebar "spine" (Sec. VI).  
* **Sacrificial (Repairable) Components:** The individual PMB blocks.

In an extreme \>100-year event, the wall is *designed to be overtopped*. The foundation and scour apron (Sec. IV) are designed to prevent undermining. The internal rebar spine (Sec. VI) is designed to provide ductility and prevent a catastrophic, brittle "domino" collapse. Failure, if it occurs, will be localized to *segmental* shifting or dislodgement of individual blocks, which remain tethered by the rebar.

### **2\. Post-Event Action Plan (The Repair Lifecycle)**

The modularity of the system enables a simple, rapid repair lifecycle:

1. **Step 1: Inspection.** A P.E. will inspect the wall for scour, settlement, and block misalignment.  
2. **Step 2: Removal.** A crane (the same equipment used for installation) 2 will lift and remove *only* the damaged or dislodged blocks.  
3. **Step 3: Replacement.** The intact, salvaged blocks (or new replacement blocks) will be **re-stacked** on the *undamaged* foundation. The hollow cores will be re-grouted. The backfill will be repaired.  
4. **Step 4: Recertification.** The wall is returned to service in a fraction of the time and cost of a monolithic wall.

### **3\. Lifecycle Cost-Benefit Analysis**

This modular repair process is the *primary* economic justification for the PMB system.

* **PMB Repair:** The cost is low and predictable. It is the cost of crane time plus replacement blocks. Repairing a 25-ft section of a block wall might cost $750-$1,250. The **Slayton Hill Road** project (NH) is a direct case study, where Redi-Rock was chosen *because* it was an "ideal fit to rapidly rebuild" and was "more economical".2  
* **CIP Repair:** A monolithic CIP wall does not fail modularly. A failure (a large structural crack, undermining, or overturning) is a *structural* failure of the *entire* monolith. Repair is *not* possible. The entire failed section must be demolished (at high cost, $10-$20/linear ft) and *rebuilt from scratch*. The cost to rebuild a 50-ft wall can be $6,000 to $14,000.

**Conclusion:** The PMB system's 30-50% lower initial cost *and* its 80-90% lower, predictable repair cost makes its total lifecycle cost *vastly* superior to a CIP alternative for this application.

## **X. Precedents & Cost-Benefit Summary**

This design methodology is not theoretical; it is validated by documented performance in real-world flood events.

### **1\. Key Case Studies**

* **Hurricane Harvey (Lumpkin Road, Houston, TX):** This is the strongest *technical* precedent. At this location, 20-foot-high Redi-Rock gravity walls at a detention basin were fully inundated, "fully saturated", and subjected to "extreme drawdown"—the exact Load Case 4\. An engineer on-site confirmed the walls "performed perfectly" with "no signs of movement or distress". This proves that a properly *drained* and *engineered* PMB system can withstand the most severe hydraulic loads.  
* **Slayton Hill Road (Lebanon, NH):** This is the strongest *economic* precedent. After a 2013 flash flood washed out the road, Redi-Rock was chosen specifically because it was an "ideal fit to rapidly rebuild" 2 and was "more economical" 2 than conventional alternatives, as it "saves excavation work".2  
* **River Wyre (United Kingdom):** This is the strongest *system* precedent. This 230-foot-long flood wall was constructed using the **Redi-Rock Freestanding Hollow-Core (F-HC)** system—the exact system specified in this report—to provide continuous flood protection.

### **2\. Final Cost & Performance Summary**

The data-driven comparison below, based on the engineering, construction, and lifecycle analyses within this report, provides a compelling and defensible justification for selecting the sacrificial, reinforced PMB system over a traditional monolithic wall.
