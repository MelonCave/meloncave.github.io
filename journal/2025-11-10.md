# Outline for Simple, Sacrificial Interlocked Concrete Faux-Boulder Flood Wall

As we think about scaffolding of a personal knowledge management system ... and the way that the structure must resist or ideally accommodate and even use different external pressures ... it's not a structure that must be perfect or must resist ALL pressures, but it should be significant enough for the scope of the project ... we might want to think about how we would build a flood wall that can resist a 6-8 ft muddy surge, using interlocking concrete blocks with a faux-boulder appearance, ie it's not about a flood wall that would resist anything, such as 2500-year or 5000-year floods -- it's basically a matter of offering protection against the most significant flood likely to be seen in 100 years. Similarly, our PKM system is PERSONAL, for things like staying abreast of trends in one's profession, investments or particular interests ... and not something that is enterprise-grade or necessary for a state or nation, but the structure of how we think about managing knowledge should be robust enough to handle the expected loads of our daily knowledge work.

Below is a somewhat detailed outline that captures the key considerations, design elements, and construction steps for beginning to think about such a project.

**Key Points**  
- Use large interlocking precast concrete blocks (e.g., Redi-Rock or similar PMB systems) with natural stone textures for a faux-boulder appearance; these 1-2 ton blocks interlock via knobs/grooves and can be steel-reinforced for stability.  
- Design as a gravity or hybrid freestanding wall 10-14 ft tall (6-8 ft water + 3-5 ft freeboard + embedment) to resist initial muddy surge via mass and deep embedment; allow overtopping or partial failure in extreme events without catastrophic collapse—it seems likely that this sacrificial approach balances cost and performance for non-1000-year floods.  
- Incorporate steel rebar in block cores + concrete infill for reinforcement; deep footings (concrete leveling pad or keyed footing embedded 4-6+ ft below anticipated scour) provide overturning/sliding resistance and scour protection.  
- Critical: robust drainage (weep holes, perforated pipe, gravel blanket) to relieve hydrostatic pressure; evidence leans toward failure from poor drainage more than surge alone.  
- Hire a licensed geotechnical/structural engineer for site-specific design—DIY risks collapse; controversy exists around unengineered block walls in flood zones, but properly designed PMB systems have proven effective in real surges.

**Overview**  
This plan creates a steel-reinforced, interlocking concrete faux-boulder retaining/flood wall that resists a 6-8 ft muddy surge through gravity mass, deep embedment, and targeted reinforcement while remaining sacrificial (rebuildable after extreme overtopping). Systems like Redi-Rock Limestone/Cobblestone blocks deliver the aesthetic and perform in documented flood events. Total cost typically 30-50% less than cast-in-place concrete for similar heights; rebuild after sacrifice feasible by replacing damaged blocks.

**Design Targets**  
- **Height**: 10-14 ft exposed (8-10 ft effective water resistance + freeboard/embedment).  
- **Loads**: Hydrostatic (γ_w h²/2 ≈ 62.4 × 8² / 2 = 2 ksf at base), surge impact (Minikin method for breaking waves), muddy debris (add 50-100% momentary load).  
- **Safety Factors** (USACE): Overturning ≥1.5, sliding ≥1.5, bearing ≥3.0 (usual conditions).  
- **Scour Protection**: Embed 4-6 ft below predicted local + general scour (use HEC-RAS or Lacey equation).  

**Quick Cost & Timeline**  
- Materials/labor: $150-300 per sq ft face (2025 pricing).  
- Build time: 2-4 weeks for 100 ft run with crane + 4-person crew.

### Comprehensive Survey Note on Constructing a Sacrificial Interlocked Concrete Faux-Boulder Flood Wall

This detailed annotated outline functions as a professional engineering roadmap for a gravity/hybrid retaining wall using large (1-2 ton) precast modular blocks (PMBs) with faux-boulder textures. The design prioritizes resisting the initial 6-8 ft muddy surge via mass, steel reinforcement, and deep embedment while permitting controlled overtopping or segmental failure in >100-year events—making it sacrificial and rebuildable. Primary system referenced: Redi-Rock (Limestone or Cobblestone texture) or equivalents (Inter-Block Enviro-Block, VERSA-LOK Brute). All steps assume coordination with a licensed geotechnical and structural engineer; local codes may require stamped plans.

#### I. Pre-Design & Site Assessment (2-4 weeks)
1. **Hydrologic/Hydraulic Study** — Determine 100-year stillwater elevation + surge (6-8 ft) + wave setup using FEMA FIRMs or HEC-RAS modeling. Add 3 ft freeboard (USACE urban standard).  
2. **Geotechnical Investigation** — Minimum 3 borings to 2× wall height. Obtain soil φ', c', γ_sat, groundwater, scour potential (use 408-type Lacey or CSU equation). Frost depth if applicable.  
3. **Scour Analysis** — Local scour ≈ 2-3 × flow depth at toe; general scour from contraction. Embed footing minimum 4-6 ft below total scour + 2 ft safety.  
4. **Survey & Utilities** — Topo survey, locate utilities, establish benchmarks.

#### II. Structural Design (4-8 weeks)
| Design Element | Requirement | Rationale & Formula |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Wall Type** | Gravity ≤10 ft exposed; Hybrid freestanding hollow-core with rebar/grout infill + optional geogrid for 10-14 ft | Sacrificial → minimize geogrid (expensive to replace); steel rebar allows segmental rebuild. |
| **Loads** | Hydrostatic p = γ_w h; Surge (Minikin breaking-wave); Impact (momentary 2-3× hydrostatic); Buoyant weight reduction | Use USACE Case I2/C2 for rapid drawdown after surge. |
| **Stability** | FS overturning ≥1.5; sliding ≥1.5; bearing ≥3.0 | Resultant in middle 1/3 base (100% compression usual loads). |
| **Reinforcement** | Vertical #6-#9 rebar @ 24-48" in cores + 4,000 psi grout; horizontal dowels into footing | Provides ductility for surge shock; epoxy-coat if saltwater. |
| **Seepage Control** | Weepholes 3" dia @ 8 ft o.c.; 4" perforated toe drain; 12" gravel blanket | Reduces uplift 50-70%; critical for muddy surge. |

#### III. Permitting & Regulatory Compliance

- Local floodplain permit; USACE 404/408 if near navigable waters.  
- ASCE 24-14 Flood Resistant Design (elevations, free-of-obstruction).

#### IV. Material Selection
- **Blocks**: Redi-Rock 28"/41"/60" wide (1,400-4,800 lb), Limestone texture, 4,000 psi wet-cast concrete, ASTM C1645 freeze-thaw.  
- **Reinforcement**: Grade 60 rebar, epoxy-coated optional.  
- **Drainage Aggregate**: Clean ASTM No.57 crushed stone.  
- **Geotextile**: Non-woven 8 oz/yd² between native soil and gravel.

#### V. Foundation & Deep Footing Construction (1-2 weeks)
1. Excavate to scour depth + 2 ft (typically 6-10 ft below grade).  
2. Pour reinforced concrete keyed footing (width = 0.7-1.0 × wall base; key 12"×12" projecting into passive wedge).  
3. Place 12" compacted leveling pad (crushed stone or concrete); tolerance ±1/8" over 10 ft.  
4. Install toe drain + filter fabric.

#### VI. Wall Erection (1-3 weeks)
1. Set base course with crane; shim <1/8".  
2. Stack in running bond; knobs lock into grooves (no mortar).  
3. Core-fill every course with rebar + 4,000 psi grout (freestanding hollow-core).  
4. Install geogrid only if engineer requires for >10 ft (PVC-coated polyester strips through PC blocks).  
5. Place drainage aggregate concurrent with lift.

#### VII. Drainage & Waterproofing
- Weepholes @ 8 ft o.c., 3" PVC with rodent screen.  
- Continuous 4" perforated sock drain daylighted every 50 ft.  
- Optional waterstop gasket between courses for semi-impervious face.  
- 12" gravel chimney + geotextile to prevent clogging by mud.

#### IX. Finishing, Access, & Maintenance
- Cap with full-width cap blocks.  
- Integrate removable flood gates (aluminum stop-log) for access.  
- Vegetation on landward side for aesthetics (not waterside—obstructs flow).  
- Annual inspection: clean weepholes, check settlement, clear debris.

#### X. Sacrificial & Contingency Provisions
- Design for 100-year surge + 20% overload; overtopping depth limited to 2 ft (erosion protection via riprap landward).  
- Segment wall every 50-75 ft with vertical joints to allow isolated failure/rebuild.  
- Post-event: crane-remove damaged blocks, re-stack on intact footing.
