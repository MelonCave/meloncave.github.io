We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-10-11.md) to build out Projects, completely RETHINKING P.A.R.A. structured PKE workflows with a today's focus on the specifics of how the PKM/PKE system can drive [time/resource prioritization and optimization](https://ancientguy.github.io/PKM/2.Areas/11TimeOptimization.html).  Prioritization and optimization are ITERATIVE and benefit from the gathering of more intelligence and analysis of body of knowledge that we have engineered. DeepResearch mode offered by AI assistants [should not be used as a magical “ask-one-question-get-all-the-answers-and-never-go-further” tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1in87ic/mastering_aipowered_research_my_guide_to_deep/). Iteration that was once tedious is now blazingly fast and easy with modern AI assistants -- however, fundamental soundness of the overall structure matters.

 As we [level up our skills in our own manual prompting techniques](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mastering-advanced-prompting-techniques-large-language-watkins-lik9e/) building a workflow toward our customized version of an [automated data-driven prompt optimizer for our iterative questioning](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/data-driven-optimizer), we want to keep the focus on the following basic architectural structure of questions and allow human-in-the-loop curiosity that proceeds from the iterations to help us as we optimize from a strong base:

* What emerging trends can be identified from recent pre-prints in [field]?
* Which recent studies in [field] introduce novel methodologies or techniques, and how do they differ from established approaches?
* How do the latest developments in [field] address ongoing challenges or gaps in knowledge highlighted in prior research?
* What are the potential real-world applications and practical implications of the most promising recent pre-prints in [field]?
* Are there any controversial or debated findings in recent [field] pre-prints, and what alternative explanations might exist?
* How do recent pre-prints in [field] build upon, extend, or contradict established paradigms in the area?
* What interdisciplinary connections or influences are evident in the latest research from [field]?
* What are the limitations, potential biases, or methodological concerns in the most influential recent pre-prints in [field]?
* Based on the trajectory or arc of trends in the last several months or years, what might be the future directions or unanswered questions for [field]?
* What are the most significant pre-prints in [field] from the last few months or years, and what are their key findings? Tools like [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) can help us visualize connections, but we also need to engage deeply with the content and not be distracted by the visuals.

We can illustrate this with the example of pre-print archives, but it applies to other forms of knowledge engineering for peer-reviewed research and technical backgrounders. Just casually browsing abstracts or reading papers posted to a pre-print archive can and does give us ideas or even the *illusion of greater competence than we have*, but we want to [be appropriately critical in our general thinking](https://journalistsresource.org/home/interpreting-academic-studies-primer-media/) as we start out. We want to proceed mentally, as we ask questions, using the [established best practices for reading a scientific paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7392212/) checking our own mindset. We want to proceed with the *skin-in-the-game* mindset that we would have professionally, if we were asked or assigned to [write a critical review of a scientific journal article](https://guides.lib.uoguelph.ca/c.php?g=708045&p=5041271) and our colleagues were counting on us to be fair, but diligently critical as we offer our unique insights. We might begin, *to get our mind ready for the process*, by [asking an AI at least 10 good questions](https://research-rebels.com/blogs/how-to-write-thesis/top-10-questions-to-ask-about-a-research-paper). This is ONLY a start, something we do just to put us in the right frame of mind, making an effort to not just ask more *dumb* robo-questions to get junk cliche answers from AI as we iteratively proceed, but [to ask the right probing questions](https://newscience.org/asking-the-right-questions/). 

It can be an iterative process, just getting our minds to speed, ie like ruminating on scripture during our own holy hour or catching up on yesterday's news during a cup of coffee in the morning, *just to wake up*. So the first questions might be just for us or to be *thrown away* or asked of an AI just in order to help us program ourselves to draft the beginning of a critical outline and then, asking even more layers of [iteratively developed questions involving future directions or questions that AI queries or our reading might provoke](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_fe26c1c3-9195-4f9e-9532-833582229548), we fill our own level of detailed insights based on [a reasonably deep understanding of recent work](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-most-effective-ways-keep-up-latest-research) in the field.
