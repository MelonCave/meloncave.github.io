## Be Better At Asking Questions, Understanding, Organizing Information 

### In Order to Become Better At Asking Questions

*The REALLY gigantic power of information technlogy is in how well the top 1% of the top 1% of the top 1% of the top 1% of the top 1% in world are using some facet of technology ... in other words, who's the VERY best -- never mind the top percentile or top 83,000,000 ... OR top 830,000 OR top 8,300 OR top 83 people -- the standard for excellence comes down to how well is THE TOP person in the world doing it ... and in order to understand something about that level of excellence, one needs to have a pretty good idea about who are the 83 that belong in the close-to-elite group.

Most people imagine that they can be elite ... not without winning some tough contest amongst the best at lower levels.

The moral of the whole story is that **humility trumps competence** ... EVEN if you have good reasons to believe that you believe that you are in the upper portion of that group of elite 82 -- you can still still learn a LOT from being familiar with the work of the best moves, traits, skills exhibited by those 82 ... think about what this means for ANY HUMAN ENDEAVOR.

You will FAIL MISSERABLY, if you start off with the assumption, that your own favorite, familiar, homegrown approach to writing code is going to better than the best OR that your lame ass can get there using an coding assistant to write code better -- **you have to be better at asking questions and organizing information.**

So ... *instead of fumbling with some coding agent like Cline in your IDE, writing the code ... to automate your dumbshit half-baked process or pull off your half-baked idea* ... 

FIRST ... understand what has already been done!

Then, when you understand what works and why, GET THE REQUIREMENTS RIGHT!

In fact, **ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS ... try to be MORE humble!!!**  

**ALWAYS** start off with the assumption that your assumptions are basically lame or way behind the curve ... START with the assumption that somebody somewhere has already done what you want to do a better way than you can imagine.

Proceed with that assumption, asking more questions, using a variety of [highly specialized search engines](https://www.paperdigest.org/copilot/?q=Biggest_100_ideas_in_AI_in_August_2025) and constantly discovering NEW, IMPROVED, BETTER search technologies that someone has come up with *recently* ... possibly complemented with various search engines in AI mode along with using AI set to use ***DeepResearch*** mode OR trying out [new experiments from Google SearchLabs offerings](https://labs.google.com/search?authuser=0) settings until you have been proven wrong.
