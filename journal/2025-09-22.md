## Be Better At Asking Questions, Understanding, Organizing Information 

### In Order to Become Better At Asking Questions

The moral of the whole story is that humility trumps competence ... there are over 8 billion other humans on the planet, you might be in the upper 1% of the upper 1% of the upper 1% of the upper 1% of competence in what you are trying to do ... but that means there are still 82 people out there who are ahead of you -- EVEN if you think that you believe that you are in the upper 1% of that group of elite 82 -- you can still still learn a LOT from being familiar with the work of the best of those 82 ... think about what this means for ANY HUMAN ENDEAVOR.

You will FAIL MISSERABLY, if you start off with the assumption, that your favorite, familiar, homegrown approach to writing code is going to better than the best OR that your lame ass can get there using an coding assistant to write code better -- **you have to be better at asking questions and organizing information.**

So ... *instead of fumbling with some coding agent like Cline in your IDE, writing the code ... to automate your dumbshit half-baked process or pull off your half-baked idea* ... 

FIRST ... understand what has already been done!

Then, when you understand what works and why, GET THE REQUIREMENTS RIGHT!

In fact, **ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS ... try to be MORE humble!!!**  

**ALWAYS** start off with the assumption that your assumptions are basically lame or way behind the curve ... START with the assumption that somebody somewhere has already done what you want to do a better way than you can imagine.

Proceed with that assumption, asking more questions, using a variety of [highly specialized search engines](https://www.paperdigest.org/copilot/?q=Biggest_100_ideas_in_AI_in_August_2025) and constantly discovering NEW, IMPROVED, BETTER search technologies that someone has come up with *recently* ... possibly complemented with various search engines in AI mode along with using AI set to use ***DeepResearch*** mode OR trying out [new experiments from Google SearchLabs offerings](https://labs.google.com/search?authuser=0) settings until you have been proven wrong.
