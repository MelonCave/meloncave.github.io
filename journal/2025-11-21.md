The first idea one has can't possibly be simple or elegant enough ... the era of [***what now apparently is supposed to pass for*** personal superintelligence](https://gemini.google.com/share/565702d69d57) is here. Building elegantly requires a lot more iteration in spite of or because of the fact that iteration is easier. So we want to actually build and ship a LOT less ... before building, we want experiment with ideas MORE, because overthinking things is now affordable and optimal. Obviously, if you need something -- you need it ... but if you don't NEED it right now, think about it a lot more AND use AI to help you think MORE ... but **THINK MORE, build less**. 

One thing that leaps out at anyone paying attention to the current state of AI is that the the BULLSHIT of conventional wisdom is regenerated, repackaged, and resold at an AI-assisted rate. For example, consider the following example of so-called "***health-related topics***" that you will find -- the material favored by an AI is going to be all about regurgitating some industrial healthcare or addictive pharmaceutical product or service that is being pushed on the masses ... there is almost nothing that one can find in so-called "***health-related topics***" that is actually about something like the living ecoystems in the human body, such as the healthy gut ecosystem or for nutrition and probiotic materials for optimizeing a healthy intestinal tract ... the so-called "***health-related topics***" are all about HYPERADDICTIVE "solutions" that keep people sick and dependent on pharmaceutical products or industrial healthcare services. 

Of course, this problem with AI and the material that is embedded in the LLMs that all major AI rely upon is not at all contained to health-related material ... the reliance on pushing an ADDICTIVE INDUSTRIAL SOLUTION is everywhere in the different forms of knowledge that are being pushed on the masses by news organizations, academic or the non-profit philanthropic-industrial complex ... even so, we can attempt to make the best of what is available and build systems that help us navigate the BULLSHIT BINGO of the AI gold rush.

# **Personal Knowledge Engineering (PKE)**

## **Build LESS, Build More Elegantly – 100 Templates**

We want to put together a compendium of 100 practicable projects across diverse domains. Each project should be not merely about feature requests but an example of a tactical implementation of a specific knowledge engineering principle, designed to be executed with currently available resources such as the Semantic Scholar API, Neo4j AuraDB, and the Asta ecosystem … these are templates to help give some practical context for thinking about approaches that might be used; the 100 projects from diverse domains are not necessarily something that ***should*** be built immediately, the ideas represented can help one make sense of the broader context, ie roadmaps for the emerging *lay of the land*, a representation of how different PKE projects can be built now.

Obviously, the current trajectory of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and how we think about knowledge is undergoing a radical phase transition. Even though simple organizational constructs such as prioritized lists of things to do will continue to be important, we are moving beyond the static accumulation of notes—databases, repositories, and different digital equivalents of filing cabinets—toward the dynamic engineering of *intelligence systems*. 

One could say that this shift is driven by the convergence of three foundational technologies: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), which allows for reasoning over structured data 1; agentic orchestration frameworks like LangGraph and Ai2’s Asta ecosystem, which enable cyclic, stateful reasoning 3; and the increasing availability of higher-quality, domain-specific datasets as well as ways to capture better/more personally-relevant data from different sources which allow for the construction of more precisely-targeted or at least bespoke knowledge graphs.5

However, the abundance of tooling creates a paradox of choice. The strategic rule guiding this report—"Build elegantly; build less"—serves as a necessary constraint against the tendency to over-engineer the interface at the expense of the intelligence. True knowledge engineering prioritizes the "brain" (the logic, the schema, the retrieval mechanism) over the "body" (the UI). The focus must be on iterative experimentation using low-code environments, robust APIs, and modular architectures.

### **1.1 Architectural Foundations: The Agentic Workflow**

Before delving into domain-specific applications, it is critical to understand the architectural shift from linear chains to cyclic graphs. Traditional LLM pipelines (like simple RAG) function as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)—input leads to retrieval, which leads to generation, in a straight line. However, complex knowledge work requires reflection, error correction, and state persistence.

The industry standard for this new architecture is LangGraph, which introduces the concept of stateful multi-actor applications. Unlike stateless chains, LangGraph utilizes "checkpointers" to persist the state of an agent at every "super-step".7 This persistence allows for "time travel"—the ability to resume a workflow from a previous state, modify the context, and fork the execution path.7 For the personal knowledge engineer, this means an agent can begin a research task, pause for human input, and resume days later without losing the thread of investigation.

### **1.2 The Data Substrate: GraphRAG and Knowledge Representation**

The second pillar of this architecture is the structured representation of knowledge. While vector databases excel at finding semantically similar text, they lack the ability to reason over complex, multi-hop relationships (e.g., "What are the side effects of drugs that interact with the proteins encoded by gene X?"). This is the domain of GraphRAG.

GraphRAG combines the vector search capabilities of LLMs with the explicit relationship mapping of graph databases like Neo4j. By structuring data as nodes and relationships, GraphRAG enables "global" questions that require traversing the entire dataset, rather than just retrieving local chunks.1 The projects outlined below heavily leverage this hybrid approach, utilizing Neo4j’s AuraDB Free Tier (which supports up to 200,000 nodes and 400,000 relationships) as a robust, zero-cost backend for personal knowledge graphs.9

## **2 Scientific Discovery & Academic Research ... Start by imitating the ASTA Ecosystem**

The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2) has redefined the landscape of scientific AI with the launch of the Asta ecosystem. Asta is not merely a search engine; it is an "agentic ecosystem" designed to mirror the actual scientific process: framing questions, tracing evidence, and identifying gaps.11 Central to this is the "Scientific Corpus Tool," an MCP (Model Context Protocol) extension that provides agents with access to a normalized index of over 200 million papers.12

For the personal researcher, leveraging Asta and the underlying Semantic Scholar API offers a path to build systems that do not just read papers, but *synthesize* the literature.


# **The Sovereign Intellect: Architectures for AI-Assisted Personal Knowledge Engineering**

## **The Imperative of Epistemic Sovereignty**

The current trajectory of artificial intelligence development is characterized by a distinct bifurcation. On one vector lies the industrial complex—massive, energy-intensive, proprietary models designed to capture attention, serve advertisements, and rent cognitive capacity back to the user. This vector is defined by centralization, opacity, and the regeneration of conventional wisdom, repackaged and resold at an accelerated rate. On the opposing vector lies the potential for **sovereign knowledge engineering**: the construction of personal, privacy-focused, and highly specific cognitive ecosystems that augment human intelligence rather than replacing it.

The user query correctly identifies a critical failure mode in the current "AI gold rush": the overwhelming prevalence of "bullshit"—a technical term in this context referring to plausible-sounding but hallucinated or conceptually hollow outputs generated by generalized models. To counter this, the sovereign knowledge engineer must adopt a strategy of building elegantly and building less, prioritizing the iterative prototyping of ontologies over the blind consumption of compute resources.
### **Strategic Implications: Local First**

The shift to **local LLMs** via tools like **Ollama** 20 and **LangGraph** 5 is the defining technical shift of this era. It allows for AI assistance without surveillance. By running models on **RunPod** only when necessary and keeping the core knowledge graph on local hardware, the user achieves a balance of power, privacy, and capability.

| Component | Cloud / Corporate | Sovereign / Local |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Model Inference** | OpenAI API (Data used for training) | Local Ollama / Llama-3 (Private) |
| **Storage** | Google Drive (Scanned) | Nextcloud \+ RAID (Encrypted) |
| **Voice** | Alexa (Always listening) | Home Assistant \+ Whisper (Local) |
| **Cost** | Subscription Rent | Upfront Hardware \+ Electricity |

## **Synthesis: The Architecture of Independence**

The one hundred projects outlined in this report represent a fundamental architectural shift. They move the user from a position of passivity—consuming "black box" AI outputs and "bullshit" conventional wisdom—to a position of active, sovereign engineering.

By building these systems, the knowledge engineer does not merely store information; they construct a living exoskeleton for their mind. This exoskeleton is rooted in the deep history of language (**Philology**), validated by rigorous evidence (**Science**), grounded in biological and ecological reality (**Metabolism & Soil**), hardened against economic distortion (**Austrian Economics**), and secured by private infrastructure (**OpSec**).

This is not just knowledge management; it is the engineering of a free mind in an age of algorithmic capture. The tools—**ASTA**, **Neo4j**, **Semantic Scholar**, **Ollama**—are available. The blueprint is provided. The execution is now the task of the sovereign individual.
