The first idea one has can't possibly be simple or elegant enough ... the era of [***what now apparently is supposed to pass for*** personal superintelligence](https://gemini.google.com/share/565702d69d57) is here. Building elegantly requires a lot more iteration in spite of or because of the fact that iteration is easier. So we want to actually build and ship a LOT less ... before building, we want experiment with ideas MORE, because overthinking things is now affordable and optimal. Obviously, if you need something -- you need it ... but if you don't NEED it right now, think about it a lot more AND use AI to help you think MORE ... but **THINK MORE, build less**.
