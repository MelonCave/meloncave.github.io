# 100 Personal Sabotage Habits from ESPN's Spectator-Focus

***Reclaim your arena!***

---

The FACT that the Creator created a universe full of billions of unique human beings means that I need to participate in the creation rather than being controlled by it. For example, I minimize the time I spend being a spectator. I need to be in control of the ideas being projected on to my mind or control the projector RATHER than sit back and watch the movie.

It's NOT JUST that the folks controlling the project pick bad movies ... the idiotic focus on the personal details of the Lane Kiffin coaching drama and the resulting attempts to drive covetousness, division, even hate ... but examining that one disgusting example is not a bad place to start ... particularly since the idiotic drama crowded out the coverage of a truly HISTORIC event in college Wrestling, the Iowa-IowaState dual in Hilton Coliseum, with opportunities for Dan Gable and Jim Gibbons to share their reflections on [***The Dual.***](https://www.flowrestling.org/video/13407352-the-dual-teaser)


## TRAINING Forges Eternal Warrior Discipline ... Discipline Forges Discipline

You can't get discipline by watching or just being a spectator.

The games themselves are not so bad ... even the stats and trivia about the games isn't that bad ... it's the spin. ESPN's screen seduces humans with induced drama (e.g., Kiffin coaching move) and its focus on scandals (e.g., MLBPA probes) or the boom in betting (e.g., DraftKings, etc)... spectator habits devour agency-building discipline, induce comfort-seeking laziness, and may even promote snack-filled nutrition.

When I find myself engaging any sort of tug to check something on ESPN, I will try to swap one ESPN habit for one jiujitsu or wrestling drill, heavy bag practice, weightlifting, or yoga.  From now on I will treat ESPN ... like I treat cravings for my sweetooth ... basically these things have to be treated as addictions, ie no different than anything else that distracts, dissaudes, diverts me from the life I could lead.

Treating something as an addiction is actually a blessing ... it gives us an opportunity to revisit the eight principles of Celebrate Recovery.

### The Eight Celebrate Recovery Principles

These 100 contrasts align with the [Eight Celebrate Recovery Principles](https://www.celebraterecovery.ca/cr-tools/8-recovery-principles/):

1. **Realize** I'm not God. I admit that I am powerless to control my tendency to do the wrong thing and that my life is unmanageable. (Matthew 5:3)
2. **Earnestly believe** that God exists, that I matter to Him, and that He has the power to help me recover. (Matthew 5:4)
3. **Consciously choose** to commit all my life and will to Christ's care and control. (Matthew 5:5)
4. **Openly examine** and confess my hurts, hang-ups, and habits to myself, to God, and to someone I trust. (Matthew 5:8)
5. **Voluntarily submit** to any and all changes God wants to make in my life and humbly ask Him to remove my character defects. (Matthew 5:6)
6. **Evaluate** all my relationships. Offer forgiveness to those who have hurt me and make amends for harm I've done to others. (Matthew 5:7, 5:9)
7. **Reserve** a daily time with God for self-examination, Bible reading, and prayer. (Steps 10-11)
8. **Yield** myself to God to be used to bring this Good News to others, both by my example and my words. (Matthew 5:10)

A key part of my own recovery discipline is about using positive discipline to crowd out negative discipline ... my tendency to just watch ESPN and the like is not going to just go away -- I need to substitute something that is more conducive to **actively LIVING** the eight principles.

### Contrasting Elite Jiujitsu and Wrestling Discipline with ESPN's Spectator-Driven Habits (Full 100 Contrasts)

***THE fundamental difference about Jiujitsu and Wrestling is in how it's participant-based and INVOLVES the participant rather than something that is spectator-driven and tells the participant to stop participating and just watch.***

In other words, elite jiujitsu and wrestling cultivate active mastery—disciplined action, resilience, and lifelong evolution—drawing from the 100 habits outlined earlier. 

Conversely, ESPN's content landscape, amid scandals like the NBA gambling arrests of Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier and the network's pivot from the failed ESPN Bet to DraftKings integration, amplifies spectator passivity. Features like live betting surges (projected $14B in in-game wagers by decade's end) and drama-fueled shows (e.g., endless Kiffin coaching rumors) pair with ads promoting "game-day" snacking, fostering sweet tooth addictions, gossip binges, and comfort-seeking over uncontrollable events. This erodes agency, turning fans into reactive consumers.

The table below expands to all 100 contrasts, thematically grouped for readability (e.g., 1-20: Discipline & Routines). Each row pairs a jiujitsu or wrestling habit with an ESPN negative, highlighting the shift from proactive warrior ethos to passive indulgence. Each item includes a referenced Bible verse aligned with the [Eight Celebrate Recovery Principles](https://www.celebraterecovery.ca/cr-tools/8-recovery-principles/).
