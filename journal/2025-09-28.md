## mdBook functionality for exploration of model and algorithmic frontiers

We are completely RE-THINKING our approach to Personal Knowledge Engineering workflows and [re-thinking AI/MCP infrastructure-as-code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qes9WB-wz7tcl-WU_d-QCXCYYMwrKwJjS3MtBewL1Q8/edit?usp=sharing) ... motivated by the recent Cloudfare blog posting on it's 'Code Mode' innovation ... [moving from Tool-Calling to Code Generation](https://g.co/gemini/share/756e95f029fe) ... instead of using MCP the way that it has been used, to instead [convert the MCP tools into a TypeScript API, and then ask an LLM to write code that calls that API](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/).

Continuing on from [the general strategy for AI-Assisted static site research discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OCd6s1NeKGp2NaZ-u52XGfkaO-0ue5YSRAPheXVfKi4/edit?usp=sharing) of on [utilizing existing resources in the emerging ecosystem for discussion of preprints](https://g.co/gemini/share/31562f83c0fd) ... today per our larger [project outline](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/projects), we *are* thinking about [domain-specific models And algorithms](http://ancientguy.github.io/PKM/2.Areas/99DomainSpecificFoundationModelsAndAlgorithmCategories.html)
