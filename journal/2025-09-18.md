Four days will be spent practicing **fundamental** tasks with Cline and OpenRouter ... and getting ideas to try by [going over the documentation with fine-tooth comb](https://docs.cline.bot/getting-started/for-new-coders) ... including [Issues that people have had in the past](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/2305) or [are having now](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/)

## ISSUES may matter most for us

We want to understand how people are effectively ***using*** an agentic assistant like Cline, not the gaseous vaporware or promises of what it WILL DO ... it's about learning Cline's interaction patterns and places where snags happen right now, even if [Cline at v 3.29.1](https://github.com/cline/cline/releases/tag/v3.29.1) is still a moving target ... it's important to NOT get too hung up on what it can't do however, but to focus on what is known to be an Issue, because bugs that give people pain have ways of becoming features. 

Simple, declarative prompts will be used, such as: "Create a new file named TODO.md and add three items," or "Read the README.md file and provide a one-paragraph summary." 

A crucial distinction to master is the difference between Cline's two primary modes: "Plan" mode, which allows for read-only exploration and task decomposition, and "Act" mode, which executes the proposed changes.

The "Auto-approve" settings will be investigated [but maybe not used] to understand the balance between the rapid, fluid experience of "vibe coding" and the safety and control of manually approving each step. 

Finally, Cline's ability to interact with the integrated terminal will be evalated  ...  to do things such as running commands like ***ls -R*** to recursively list the project's file structure, confirming its ability to observe and interact with its environment.
