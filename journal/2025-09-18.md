## Practicing **Fundamental** Dev Tasks ... Using Cline, et al

The state-of-the-art in the capability of AI-assistants, like Cline is a rapidly moving target.

Starting out, we thought four days [in this Module] would be spent practicing **fundamental** dev tasks with Cline / OpenRouter ... now we can see that perhaps most of the time will be spent looking at competing, even lower-cost approaches that are out there already for other things.  

For instance, we might look at [how Gemini might manage a Gmail inbox](https://g.co/gemini/share/beaefdc1d3a8) ... AI that used to cost something are now being given away, eg like calendars, matchbooks, pens, flyswatters or solar caculators once were, in order to fish for customers who might opt-in on annual subscriptions.

Understanding the competitive universe is probably best, unless one NEEDS to settle down and actaully get some work done with one tool ... ***but WHY?***


We might get some ideas to try by [going over the documentation with fine-tooth comb](https://docs.cline.bot/getting-started/for-new-coders) ... including [Issues that people have had in the past](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/2305) or [are having now](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/)

We want to understand how people are effectively ***using*** an agentic assistant, that is under heavy development, like Cline is, not get too lost in the gaseous vaporware or discussions of what it WILL DO or where the tech might be going... it's about learning Cline's interaction patterns and places where the bigger snags happen right now ... Cline is remarkably polished, but still far different than using something like [Git at v 2.52](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.52.0.adoc) ... yes, [Cline at v 3.29.1](https://github.com/cline/cline/releases/tag/v3.29.1) might seem somewhat mature to some -- it's still really new, not enough people have used it in different situations, so it's still a moving target ... it's important to NOT get too hung up on what it can't do however, but to focus on what is known to be an Issue, because bugs that give people pain have ways of becoming features. 

Simple, declarative prompts will be used, such as: "Create a new file named TODO.md and add three items," or "Read the README.md file and provide a one-paragraph summary." 

A crucial distinction to master is the difference between Cline's two primary modes: "Plan" mode, which allows for read-only exploration and task decomposition, and "Act" mode, which executes the proposed changes.

The "Auto-approve" settings will be investigated [but maybe not used] to understand the balance between the rapid, fluid experience of "vibe coding" and the safety and control of manually approving each step. 

Finally, Cline's ability to interact with the integrated terminal will be evalated  ...  to do things such as running commands like ***ls -R*** to recursively list the project's file structure, confirming its ability to observe and interact with its environment.
