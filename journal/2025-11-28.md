# MelonCave Podcast Thinking III: Neuroarchitecture, Cognitive Science, Generative Engine Optimization

This daily log entry is a collection of reactions and hot takes on the ***first rough attempt*** ... it's not really a full revision or second attempt at providing an exhaustive strategic framework for the MelonCave podcast ... just immediate gut-level reactions. 

I think that podcasts and webconfs might be best represented as curated confluences of related materials ... every event is basically an everygreen annotated connection of links.

For example, I was thinking about an upcoming virtual seminar, [Deeper Talks: Measuring Dijets From Ultra-Peripheral Heavy Ion Collisions](https://events.zoom.us/e/view/aOCy9296QRiJpBsywDT1sA/purchase) ... which led to pondering ongoing work at [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) because of 2011 paper on [A Search for New Physics Processes using Dijet Events](https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225456/http://www.atlas.ch/news/2011/search-for-new-physics-dijet-events.html) ... in order to get a sense of context, one might ask, [what's dijet event?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijet_event) ... [what's a jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(particle_physics)) ... [what's a parton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parton_(particle_physics)) ... and why might things like partons matter for something like representing the [world as a hologram](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9409089)
