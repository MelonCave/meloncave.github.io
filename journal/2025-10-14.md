We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-10-13.md) with a deeper push into decentralized science (DeSci), particularly motivated by a desire to learn more about the state of developments that center on the [tokenization of peer-reviewed of pre-print publicications](https://blog.researchhub.foundation/peer-reviewing-on-researchhub/). The movement toward DeSci is a direct response to a set of deeply entrenched, systemic failures resulting from traditional architectures of academic and scientific research (TradSci). These almost predictable TradSci failures involve significant frictions in the process of incentivizing research programs, not just slowing the pace of discovery but actively thwarting or sabotaging the incentives of researchers, misaligning research programs and giving rise to paywalls and predatory author-pay predatory publishers and closed-access pay-to-present web conferences. Although proponents of TradSci will argue about the severity or degree of these failures, a direct consequence [which noboby contests] of these misaligned incentives in the academic research factories is the well-documented reproducibility crisis. Some estimates of the reproducibility crisis are failure rates of 50% or even higher in certain fields, but the general uncertainty resulting from this crisis not only wastes taxpayer money and research resources but also generally erodes public trust in science. This has happened because of TradSci well-known its tendency toward building "research-for-conclusion" funding machinery, eg to prove that Pfizer's product does not cause harm. The issue with mercenary academic siloes is about undermining more open, competitive advancment of shared human knowledge. 

Thus, after some preliminary investigation and iterative prompt engineering, Gemini was prompted to generate a exploratory summary backgrounder on the state of DeSci, with a particular focus on the role of AI in this emerging collaborative ecosystem. The following include a [summarized hi-level snapshot](https://g.co/gemini/share/91a92708a38c) as well as our [lightly-edited, more verbose output](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xTUH7bzawo9M_8CkftADTosV1rHmuCrtr-pLHdfG-Q/edit?usp=sharing).
