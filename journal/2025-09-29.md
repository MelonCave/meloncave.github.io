## Best platform for building Rust-based AI Agents, APIs, tools

As we re-read Sun Tzu, Thucydides, Machevelli, Clausewitz, [Liddell-Hart's Strategy](), we continue to completely RETHINK our approach to Personal Knowledge Engineering workflows ... for how we can attack the problem of learning and engineering knowledge ... we are thinking about [the general strategic architecture of Recursive RL algorithms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FtouGTDYHCKcX3LY8FZ_yyu8WKfXQLyQu0GzsFPuH-w/edit?usp=sharing) that rapidly do minimal explorations or *mining deep dives as test*, "learn the ropes" of what's down there or get a good idea about the big picture, then trust the early wins and self-imitate the most promising approaches with
progressive rounds of additional exploration for agentic learn-it-goes reinforcement learning.  We believe that [algorithms, APIs, toolchains and AI platforms](https://g.co/gemini/share/a0bb09c0b7fa) of this nature will be best implemented in Rust.
