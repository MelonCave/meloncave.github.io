As we noted on [October 31st](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-10-31.md), our PKM tool will likely move in the direction of just ***simply(?)*** relying on automating Browser-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms.

We should perhaps elaborate ... ultimately in the automated version of Personal Knowledge ENGINEERING, PKM becomes about efficient building context *more rapidly than a human can go through the tedious process of grokking context*

That means looking at [PKM/PKE automation tools that for knowledge ontologies, but ***somewhat like*** SWE-grep for code](https://cognition.ai/blog/swe-grep#motivation) ... so that means looking at BaaS platforms that provide robust and scalable web infrastructure designed specifically for AI agents, with capabilities like browser automation, anti-bot handling, proxy management, and stealth mode.

Hyperbrowser.ai is a cloud-based browser infrastructure platform designed for AI agents, offering scalable, secure browser sessions for web automation, scraping, and interactions with low latency and easy integration via APIs.

We looked at other options and basically decided that our best choices probably was Strawberry Browser OR BrowserOS

Based on 2025 reviews and official details, Strawberry Browser and BrowserOS are both agentic AI browsers designed for task automation, but they cater to different needs. Strawberry focuses on specialized, collaborative AI companions for professional workflows, while BrowserOS emphasizes open-source, privacy-focused, on-device automation. Neither fully replaces traditional browsers like Chrome yet, but they excel in multi-agent handling of web tasks. Here's a detailed side-by-side comparison:

| Aspect | Strawberry Browser | BrowserOS |
|--------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Developer** | Strawberry (independent startup, launched 2025) | BrowserOS (open-source project, Y Combinator-backed) |
| **Key Features** | - AI companions (e.g., Sales Sally for lead gen, Competition Camille for competitor analysis, Assistant Astrid for email management) that interact with tabs (scroll, click, type).<br>- Custom companions and no-code workflows.<br>- Approval required for key actions; integrates with tools like Notion, Zapier, Google Sheets.<br>- Handles multi-step tasks like research, data extraction, outreach. | - Natural language commands to automate tasks (e.g., "scrape prices and add to spreadsheet").<br>- Local AI agents for privacy; supports Ollama/local models or cloud APIs.<br>- Semantic search for history/bookmarks; Chrome extension compatibility.<br>- Split-view for LLMs like ChatGPT/Claude; MCP servers for apps like Gmail/Notion. |
| **Platforms & Availability** | - Cross-platform (desktop via Electron/Chromium); beta with waitlist. | - Windows, macOS, Linux; open-source download (AGPL-3.0 license). |
| **Pricing** | - Free: $0/mo, 2,000 credits.<br>- Pro: $20/mo, 8,000 credits, priority support.<br>- Ultra: $250/mo, 50,000 credits, dedicated support.<br>- Team: $40/mo per seat, 8,000 credits/seat, custom limits.<br>- Credits for AI actions ($10/1,000 extra); browsing free. | - Free to use/install; open-source.<br>- Optional costs for cloud AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI); local models free. |
| **Pros** | - Tailored for B2B/professional use; learns user styles over time.<br>- Strong integration and customization; high praise for time savings in workflows.<br>- Secure with action approvals. | - Privacy-focused with on-device processing; no subscriptions.<br>- Open-source flexibility; compatible with existing Chrome ecosystem.<br>- Good for data scraping and automation without coding. |
| **Cons** | - Credit-based limits may add up for heavy use; beta-stage bugs.<br>- Higher costs for advanced plans; less emphasis on casual browsing. | - Relies on user-provided AI models/APIs; may require setup for local LLMs.<br>- Less specialized companions; potential resource usage on lower-end devices. |
| **User Reviews & Ratings** | - 4.8/5 average; lauded for productivity in sales/research, but some note early rough edges. | - Positive for privacy and openness; seen as a strong alternative to paid options, with community feedback via Discord/Slack. |
| **Best For** | Professionals/teams in sales, recruiting, or research needing customized, multi-step automation. | Privacy-conscious users or developers wanting free, local AI for general web tasks like scraping or form handling. |

### Key Differences & Recommendations
- **Automation Approach**: Strawberry uses role-specific companions for collaborative, approved workflows, ideal for business efficiency. BrowserOS leverages natural language for on-device agents, prioritizing privacy and simplicity without ongoing costs.
- **Maturity & Focus**: Strawberry is more polished for pro use but subscription-based; BrowserOS is lightweight and community-driven, better for tinkerers.
- **Choose Strawberry** for team-oriented, specialized automation in a paid ecosystem. **Choose BrowserOS** for free, private, open-source flexibility. Both are rapidly evolving—visit their sites for the latest. If you have a specific use case, let me know!
