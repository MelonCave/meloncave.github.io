# R&D Funding Sources for Scientists, Engineers, and Tinkerers Across the Innovation Ecosystem

The reason that we look the topic of funding sources is that we need to be practical in terms of thinking about how the mission of the project is going to produce a self-sustaining impetus to continually drive the funding for improving the effort ... or OTHERWISE we're just another lame ass philanthropy that always has to be begging for funding.  IMPROVING the cognitive abilities of humans should be a self-sustaining ... although at first we may need to look at sources of funding from things that SHOULD value cognitive abilities especially highly, ie we probably start with thinnking about DARPA funding or what kinds of technologies DARPA ***SHOULD*** be funding.

To round out this list, while [Candid's Foundation Directory Online (FDO)](https://candid.org/) is perhaps the most comprehensive database for U.S. private foundations, holding extensive information on grantmakers similar to the [Tinker Foundation](https://tinker.org/about-us/#overview), which supports “**people**, projects, and **ideas**” to promote economic and social development particularly in Latin America.  [Grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov/) is also a very prominent resource, but there are several other databases aggregate grant opportunities with unique focuses, target audiences, or funding levels offering their services at different price points. Some of these lesser-known private for-hire or specialized grant databases include:

* [Instrumentl](https://www.instrumentl.com/): This platform focuses on intelligent matching algorithms and integrated project management for the entire grant lifecycle, including insights from funders' past tax filings (990s). It is a premium, but highly rated, tool.

* [GrantStation](https://grantstation.com/): A database that covers national and international grants from private, corporate, and government sources. It's often considered more affordable than FDO and provides resources for Canadian funders as well.

* [Grant Gopher](https://grantgopher.com/): Designed specifically for small, U.S.-based nonprofits and schools, offering a simple interface and an affordable (or free limited-functionality) plan.

* [Pivot-RP](https://pivot.proquest.com/): Highly specialized for academic institutions, faculty, staff researchers, and graduate students. It aggregates global funding opportunities and links researchers with matching grants.

* [GrantWatch](https://www.grantwatch.com/): A budget-friendly option featuring thousands of active grants from various sources, including foundations, corporations, and governments, suitable for nonprofits, small businesses, and individuals.

* [Devex Pro Funding](https://pgs.devex.com/devex-pro-funding): A niche database devoted to the global development and international philanthropy fields, compiling opportunities from over 800 funders worldwide.

* [Philanthropy News Digest (PND) RFP Bulletin](https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/rfps): A free service that publishes RFPs and notices of awards from foundations and non-profit organizations. It's a manual list rather than a full database but is a valuable resource.
