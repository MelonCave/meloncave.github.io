Screening, sifting, sorting is something that is extremely tedious when done manually and leaves the manual screener cognitively overwhelmed. Of course, AI lacks a point of view or vision of where one *SHOULD* focus ... AI cannot give humans their *SHOULD DO THIS FIRST* vision, but it can help with the tasks of sorting, indexing, pattern-recognizing.  Thus, search engines or search algorithms are appropriate for AI-assisted vision necessary for knowledge engineering ... OR to put it differently for human-assisted intelligent machine screening. 

To develop actionable insights from our PKM/PKE, we can look at creating a framework called **CAN SLIM for Science** or [adapt something like the CAN SLIM method used for beginning the idea screening methodology](https://gemini.google.com/share/3dd480e1d434) that is used in commitment of capital to a analogous philosophy that might be used to allocate time and energy to the much deeper exploration of scientific research. To operationalize this or implement this system, we can foresee building a pipeline in Python, with some steps being candidates for implementation in Rust or Go for performance optimization. The high-level architecture might look like this:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Use APIs to harvest daily/weekly preprints (e.g., `arxiv` Python library).

2. **Processing**: Apply NLP/topic modeling to categorize and score per CAN SLIM criteria.

3. **Ranking**: Aggregate scores (e.g., weighted sum: 30% C+A, 20% N, etc.) to output top 10-15 "leader" topics, with alerts for surges.

4. **Visualization**: Use matplotlib for trend charts; integrate with dashboards like Streamlit.

5. **Risk Management**: Analogous to stop-loss, filter out topics with red flags (e.g., high retraction rates in related fields).

This system could be prototyped using offline datasets in a REPL environment, then deployed with cloud services for real-time scanning. For immediate use, we might start with things that are already working, using ideas from ResearchHub or AlphaXiv.org or ArxivLabs or ResearchRabbit or Semantic Scholar to manually apply these filters ... using tools in manual sense, but eventually evolving toward full automation with data APIs. 

The PKM/PKE system would algorithmically scan things like preprint archives (e.g., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, chemRxiv, SSRN, et al) to identify emerging research themes, technologies, and ideas with the most rapid improvement potential. The goal is to spot "leader" topics before they explode into *mainstream* breakthroughs that attract more attention and commitment of research talent and capital, focusing on areas where science can advance quickest—such as novel methodologies, interdisciplinary fusions, or solutions to pressing problems like climate tech or AI ethics. The POINT of doing this is to understand what kinds of resources and technologoies would become most impactful and sought by the research sector in the near future.

The CAN SLIM method [or a synthesis/adaptation of similar methods used by successful investors] is used by investors to initially filter stocks and stock sectors for growth signals ... in a similar manner, our PKE system would analogously use data sources such as APIs from preprint servers, natural language processing (NLP), and trend analytics to evaluate research topics. The underlying screening algorithm might combine "fundamental" metrics (e.g., publication quality and novelty) with "technical" signals (e.g., submission volume spikes and citation trajectories). Implementation could involve open-source tools like the arXiv API for data fetching, Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn for clustering, NLTK or Hugging Face transformers for NLP), and databases for tracking trends over time. 

Of course, it bears emphasis that the point of this exercise is not to reinvent the wheel, but to use the best tools and technologies available to develop the PKE screening tool. Existing platforms like ResearchRabbit, Semantic Scholar, or Litmaps already offer AI-driven components for this, which could be customized or integrated. In very rough and approxiate terms we can map the letters of original *CAN SLIM* acronym to scientific equivalents, with criteria and algorithmic detection methods. This forms a step-by-step system for scanning and ranking topics.

# **Idea-Generation-to-Validation Screen**

## **Section 1: Learning From Tools Like the CAN SLIM Framework for High-Growth Stock Identification**

The CAN SLIM methodology, developed by William J. O'Neil, represents a systematic approach to identifying high-potential growth stocks prior to their most significant price appreciation phases.1 This framework is not the product of abstract theory but is the result of an extensive historical analysis of the top-performing stocks in the U.S. market, with O'Neil's foundational study covering market winners from 1880 to 2009\.3 The system's enduring appeal lies in its structured, seven-criterion process that integrates both fundamental and technical analysis.6 The fundamental components—represented by the letters C, A, N, and I—focus on a company's financial health and catalysts for growth, while the technical and market-timing components—S, L, and M—evaluate price action, relative performance, and the overall market environment.9

The central thesis of CAN SLIM is to identify stocks that are beginning to attract the attention of large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pension funds, and to establish a position before the full weight of their capital drives the stock's price substantially higher.10 It is, at its core, a strategy designed to capture momentum in stocks that possess strong underlying growth characteristics. This approach is not passive; it requires active monitoring and a disciplined framework for both entry and exit, making it particularly well-suited for a quantitative screening aide that can automate the initial identification process.2

### **1.1 C – Current Quarterly Earnings Per Share (EPS)**

The first criterion, 'C', emphasizes powerful and recent earnings performance. This is arguably the most critical component of the initial screen, as a sharp increase in a company's profitability is a primary catalyst that captures the market's attention and signals strong underlying business momentum.6 The methodology requires a significant increase in a company's earnings per share (EPS) for the most recent quarter when compared to the same quarter of the previous year.8 This year-over-year comparison is crucial as it accounts for seasonal variations in a company's business cycle, providing a more accurate measure of true growth.

The quantitative thresholds for this metric are demanding. The most frequently cited benchmark is a minimum year-over-year (YoY) EPS increase of 25%.6 Some analyses suggest a slightly more lenient range of 20-25% may be acceptable, while others advocate for a more aggressive screen targeting growth of 25-50% or even higher.2 The historical analysis of market winners reveals that the most explosive stock price movements are often preceded by quarterly EPS growth in the range of 50-100%, or even more.10 A highly positive secondary indicator is an *accelerating* rate of growth over the past several quarters, which suggests that the company's momentum is building rather than plateauing.9

To ensure that this earnings growth is not an anomaly or the result of financial engineering, the framework suggests examining supporting metrics. A high and stable Return on Equity (ROE), with a suggested threshold of 17% or higher, indicates that the company is generating profits efficiently from its shareholders' equity, lending credibility to the sustainability of the EPS gains.10 Furthermore, this earnings growth should be supported by robust sales growth, confirming that the increased profitability is driven by genuine demand for the company's products or services.2

### **1.2 A – Annual Earnings Growth**

The 'A' criterion serves as a validation of the recent quarterly performance by demanding a history of consistent, long-term profitability. While a company might manage to produce a single impressive quarter through cost-cutting or other temporary measures, it is far more difficult to sustain strong earnings growth over a period of several years.10 This factor is designed to filter out ephemeral successes and identify companies with a proven track record of effective management and a durable business model.7

The quantitative standard for annual growth is as rigorous as the quarterly requirement. The ideal candidate should demonstrate a minimum annual EPS growth rate of 25% over the preceding three to five years.10 This consistency indicates a fundamentally sound and well-managed enterprise. Alternative interpretations of the rule suggest a compound annual growth rate over five years of at least 24%, or a range of 15-25% over three to five years.6 This slight variation across sources suggests that the precise threshold could be a configurable parameter within a screening tool, allowing for adjustment based on prevailing market conditions and the overall growth rate of the economy. For instance, during a low-growth economic environment, a 15% annual growth rate might be considered exceptional, whereas during a boom, a 25% hurdle might be more appropriate.

The historical precedent for this rule is compelling. Before Google (now Alphabet Inc.) experienced a five-fold increase in its stock price in 2004, the company had a three-year annual EPS growth rate of 293%, a clear illustration of how powerful, sustained growth precedes extraordinary market returns.10

### **1.3 N – New Products, New Management, New Highs**

The 'N' criterion introduces a more qualitative element, focusing on the presence of a significant catalyst that can propel a company to new levels of growth and capture the market's imagination.7 This catalyst can take several forms: a game-changing new product or service that disrupts an industry, a new and highly effective management team that improves efficiency and strategy, or a significant positive shift in the company's industry landscape.2 The essence of this factor is that great stock market runs are often initiated by something new and exciting that fundamentally changes a company's prospects.11

While the "New Product" or "New Management" aspects are inherently qualitative and require discretionary analysis, the "New Highs" component provides a quantifiable proxy for screening purposes. This technical element refers to the stock's price breaking out of a period of consolidation and reaching, or trading near, its 52-week high.9 This price action serves as a technical confirmation that the market is responding positively to the company's developments and that demand is beginning to overwhelm supply.14

For the purpose of building a quantitative screening aide, this criterion can be translated into specific parameters:

* **Price Proximity to 52-Week High:** The stock's current price should be within 15% of its 52-week high.9 This ensures that the screener focuses on stocks that are already demonstrating strong momentum and market favor.  
* **Consolidation Breakout:** The move to a new high should follow a period of price consolidation (a sideways trading pattern) lasting at least seven weeks.10 This chart pattern, often referred to as a "base," is a critical part of the system's timing component, as it suggests that the stock has absorbed overhead supply and is poised for a significant upward move.2

### **1.4 S – Supply and Demand**

This criterion shifts the focus from the company's fundamentals to the market dynamics of its stock. The principle of 'S' is rooted in the basic economic law of supply and demand. The ideal CAN SLIM candidate is a stock with a relatively limited supply of shares available for trading (known as a small "float") that is experiencing strong and increasing demand from investors.6 This imbalance is what creates the potential for rapid and substantial price appreciation.7

Several quantitative indicators can be used to screen for these characteristics:

* **Shares Outstanding:** The system favors companies with a smaller number of shares outstanding, as this limits the available supply. One specific guideline suggests looking for companies with fewer than 50 million shares.14 This characteristic is particularly common among the innovative small- and mid-cap companies that O'Neil's research identified as frequent top performers.6  
* **Trading Volume:** A surge in trading volume that accompanies a price increase is one of the most powerful technical confirmations in the CAN SLIM system. It indicates that large institutional investors are actively accumulating shares, providing the buying pressure needed for a sustained move.2 A screening tool could look for days where volume is significantly above its 50-day average. As a baseline liquidity filter, a minimum average daily trading volume of 1 million shares is a reasonable parameter to ensure the stock can be traded efficiently.9  
* **Corporate Share Buybacks:** When a company repurchases its own stock, it directly reduces the number of shares available on the open market. This action not only tightens the supply but also serves as a strong signal of management's confidence in the company's future prospects.8

### **1.5 L – Leader or Laggard**

The 'L' criterion is a simple yet powerful directive: within any given industry, an investor should always choose the leading stocks over the underperforming ones, or laggards.7 Market leaders typically exhibit superior price performance, stronger fundamentals, and greater innovation than their competitors.11 The goal is to invest in the best-of-breed companies that are gaining market share and are recognized by the market as the top players in their field.

The primary quantitative metric for identifying market leaders is **Relative Strength (RS)**, also referred to as Relative Price Strength (RPS).6 The RS rating is a measure of a stock's price performance over a specific period, typically the last 12 months, compared to all other stocks in the market. It is usually scored on a scale of 1 to 99\. The CAN SLIM methodology requires a stock to have an **RS rating of 80 or higher**.6 This means the stock has outperformed at least 80% of all other stocks in the database over the past year, clearly identifying it as a market leader.

It is critical to distinguish the Relative Strength (RS) rating from the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RS rating compares a stock's performance to the rest of the market, while the RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions for a single stock. One source 11 incorrectly suggests using the RSI and looking for laggard (oversold) stocks. This is a fundamental misinterpretation and is in direct contradiction to O'Neil's entire philosophy of buying strong stocks that are outperforming the market. For the purpose of a CAN SLIM screen, the correct metric is unequivocally the Relative Strength rating.

### **1.6 I – Institutional Sponsorship**

The 'I' criterion acknowledges the critical role that institutional investors play in the stock market. Because of their immense buying power, the sustained accumulation of a stock by mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds is the primary force that drives significant price increases.6 Furthermore, the presence of high-quality institutional owners lends a degree of credibility to a stock, as it implies that these professional investors have conducted thorough due diligence and have confidence in the company's future.7

However, this criterion is not as simple as finding stocks with the highest level of institutional ownership. The key is to identify a "sweet spot." A successful screen must find stocks that are attracting institutional interest but are not yet "over-owned."

* **Presence of Quality Institutions:** The stock should have at least one, and preferably several, well-performing institutions as shareholders.11 The quality of the sponsor matters as much as the quantity.  
* **Increasing Ownership Trend:** A highly positive signal is a steady increase in the number of institutional owners over the past few quarters.6 This indicates that accumulation is currently underway.  
* **Avoidance of Over-Ownership:** The ideal time to invest is *before* the stock becomes a consensus holding among institutions. If institutional ownership becomes excessively high—one source suggests avoiding stocks with ownership above 90% 6—the pool of potential new buyers shrinks significantly. At this point, the stock becomes vulnerable to a sharp decline if a few large institutions decide to sell, as there may not be enough new buyers to absorb the supply.11

### **1.7 M – Market Direction**

The final criterion, 'M', is a critical top-down filter that governs the entire strategy. O'Neil's research concluded that the vast majority of stocks, regardless of their individual merits, will follow the direction of the overall market.2 Attempting to buy even the most promising growth stock during a bear market is a low-probability endeavor. Therefore, the CAN SLIM system dictates that new investments should only be made when the major market indexes are in a confirmed uptrend.6 A stock may satisfy all of the first six criteria, but if the market direction is negative, the investment should be deferred.12

Assessing the market direction is not a matter of subjective opinion but can be determined through several objective technical indicators:

* **Major Index Analysis:** Monitor the price action of key market indexes such as the S\&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite.6  
* **Moving Averages:** A primary signal of a healthy market is when the major indexes are trading above their key long-term moving averages, particularly the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.6  
* **Market Breadth:** Indicators such as the advance-decline line, which measures the number of advancing stocks minus the number of declining stocks, can provide insight into the health of the underlying trend. A rising index accompanied by weakening breadth can be a warning sign.6

The combination of these criteria defines CAN SLIM as a momentum-growth strategy. The system is explicitly designed to identify companies with high earnings growth ('C', 'A') and positive catalysts ('N') that are already exhibiting strong price performance ('L') and are being bought by institutions ('I'), and to purchase them only when the broad market trend is favorable ('M'). This is not a passive, "buy and hold" strategy in the traditional sense. It is an actively managed, trend-following system. The strict discipline of cutting all losses at 7-8% below the purchase price further underscores its active nature, focusing on capital preservation when a trade moves against the investor.10 For a screening aide, this implies that the 'M' criterion should act as a master "regime filter." The screener should be designed to be run frequently, as the list of qualifying stocks is highly dynamic and dependent on both individual company performance and the prevailing market environment.

Furthermore, while many of the CAN SLIM criteria are easily quantifiable, a purely mechanical application misses some of the system's nuances. The 'N' criterion (New Product/Management) and the interpretation of chart patterns for the 'S' and 'N' criteria are inherently subjective.1 The 'I' criterion is also not a simple filter but requires finding a "sweet spot" of ownership. This suggests that a screening aide should be designed as a two-stage process. The first stage is a **Quantitative Sieve**, which applies the hard, numerical filters (e.g., EPS growth \> 25%, RS rating \> 80\) to generate a manageable list of candidates. The second stage is a **Qualitative Dashboard**, which presents the shortlisted stocks alongside supplementary data to help a human analyst evaluate the softer criteria. This dashboard could display recent news headlines and press releases to assess the 'N' criterion, or visualize the trend of institutional ownership over time to evaluate the 'I' criterion. This two-stage approach respects the data-driven nature of the system while accommodating the discretionary judgment it was designed to incorporate.

| Criterion (Acronym) | Core Principle | Primary Quantitative Metric(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **C** \- Current Quarterly EPS | Strong recent profitability and business momentum. | YoY EPS Growth \> 25%; Accelerating quarterly growth. |
| **A** \- Annual EPS Growth | Consistent, long-term growth and effective management. | 3-5 Year Annual EPS Growth \> 25%. |
| **N** \- New Catalyst / New High | A significant positive event driving future growth. | Price within 15% of 52-week high after a consolidation period. |
| **S** \- Supply & Demand | Scarcity of shares coupled with high investor interest. | Shares Outstanding \< 50M; High trading volume on price increases. |
| **L** \- Leader or Laggard | Industry outperformance and market dominance. | Relative Strength (RS) Rating \> 80\. |
| **I** \- Institutional Sponsorship | Validation and buying power from professional investors. | Increasing number of quality institutions; not yet "over-owned." |
| **M** \- Market Direction | A favorable macroeconomic environment for growth stocks. | Major indexes in a confirmed uptrend (e.g., above 50/200 Day Moving Averages). |

## **Section 2: Foundational Principles of Value Investing: The Graham-Dodd Doctrine**

In stark contrast to the momentum-driven philosophy of CAN SLIM, the value investing doctrine, pioneered by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, represents a fundamentally different approach to the equity markets.16 Often hailed as the "father of value investing," Graham laid out a defensive, risk-averse framework designed to protect an investor's principal while seeking a satisfactory, though not necessarily spectacular, return.16 This methodology is not concerned with market trends, price momentum, or short-term sentiment. Instead, it is grounded in a meticulous, business-like analysis of a company's financial statements to determine its intrinsic value, and it advocates for purchasing securities only when they are available at a substantial discount to this value.16

### **2.1 Core Tenets of the Graham Philosophy**

Graham's entire philosophy can be distilled into a few powerful, interconnected concepts that have influenced generations of investors, most notably Warren Buffett or Seth Klarman [per ***Margin of Safety***] or [similar resources](https://www.danielmnke.com/p/resources). 

* **Investment vs. Speculation:** Graham began by drawing a sharp distinction between investing and speculating. He provided a strict definition: "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative".16 This principle places paramount importance on thorough analysis and the preservation of capital, viewing any activity that relies on market forecasting or price prediction as speculation.  

* **The "Mr. Market" Allegory:** To teach the importance of emotional discipline, Graham created the allegory of "Mr. Market," a manic-depressive business partner who, each day, offers to buy your shares or sell you his at a price dictated by his mood.16 On some days, he is euphoric and offers ridiculously high prices; on other days, he is despondent and offers to sell at a deep discount. The intelligent investor, Graham taught, should not be influenced by Mr. Market's irrational whims. Instead, the investor should view him as a servant, ignoring him on most days but taking advantage of his moments of extreme pessimism to buy assets for far less than they are worth.16  

* **Intrinsic Value and the Margin of Safety:** The cornerstone of Graham's approach is the concept of "margin of safety".17 The process begins with the investor conducting a thorough analysis of a company's assets, earnings power, and financial stability to arrive at an estimate of its intrinsic value—what the business is fundamentally worth, independent of its current stock price.18 An investment is considered only when the market price is significantly below this calculated intrinsic value. This discount between the price paid and the estimated value is the margin of safety.16 Its purpose is to provide a cushion against errors in judgment, unforeseen negative events, or the simple bad luck that can affect any investment. It is the ultimate defense against permanent loss of capital.  

* **The Market as a Weighing Machine:** This concept encapsulates the long-term perspective of value investing. Graham observed that in the short run, the stock market behaves like a "voting machine," driven by popularity, sentiment, and speculation. However, in the long run, it acts as a "weighing machine," where the stock price will eventually reflect the true, underlying value of the business.16 The value investor's strategy is therefore one of patience, waiting for the market to recognize and correct its pricing errors, allowing the stock price to converge with its intrinsic value.20

### **2.2 A Quantifiable Screen for the "Defensive Investor"**

Graham recognized that not all investors have the time or inclination for the deep, complex analysis required of an "enterprising" investor. For the more passive or "defensive" investor, he outlined a set of simpler, more rigid criteria designed to identify sound and undervalued companies with minimal effort.16 These criteria, detailed in his book *The Intelligent Investor*, are exceptionally well-suited for translation into a quantitative screening model.21

A screen based on Graham's principles for the defensive investor would incorporate the following quantitative thresholds:

* **Quality Rating:** The company should have an average or better quality rating from a reputable service like Standard & Poor's. A specific recommendation is to require an S\&P Earnings and Dividend Rating of B+ or better to ensure a baseline level of corporate quality.21  

* **Low Leverage:** To avoid companies with risky financial structures, the Total Debt to Current Assets ratio should be less than 1.10. This ensures that the company's current assets are more than sufficient to cover its total debt obligations.21  

* **Strong Liquidity:** The Current Ratio, calculated as Current Assets divided by Current Liabilities, should be greater than 1.50. This indicates a strong ability to meet short-term financial obligations.21  

* **Earnings Stability and Growth:** The company must have demonstrated profitability over the long term. The screen should require positive earnings per share growth over the past five years, with no single year showing an earnings deficit (a loss) during that period.21  

* **Low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** To ensure a bargain price, the P/E ratio should be 9.0 or less. This strict valuation criterion filters for companies that are statistically cheap relative to their recent earnings power.21  

* **Low Price-to-Book (P/BV) Ratio:** The P/BV ratio, which compares the stock price to the company's net asset value per share, should be less than 1.20. This provides an additional layer of safety by ensuring the investor is not paying a significant premium over the company's tangible assets.21  

* **Consistent Dividends:** The company should currently be paying a dividend. This provides the investor with a tangible return while patiently waiting for the market to recognize the stock's undervaluation.20

The philosophies of Graham and O'Neil represent two fundamentally different worldviews. Graham's criteria are based on **absolute value**. A stock is either cheap (P/E \< 9\) or it is not, regardless of its industry, growth rate, or what other stocks are doing. This is a search for a fair company at a wonderful price. In contrast, CAN SLIM's 'L' criterion (Leader) is based on **relative value**. A stock is a leader only if it is outperforming 80% of its peers. This is a search for a wonderful company at a fair (or even high, but rapidly rising) price. Graham's focus is on the balance sheet and downside protection ("safety of principal"), while O'Neil's is on the income statement and upside potential ("significant price appreciation"). A screening aide must be designed to accommodate these two distinct modes of analysis, as the lists of stocks they generate are unlikely to have significant overlap.

Furthermore, the Graham approach is inherently a **contrarian, mean-reversion strategy**. The Mr. Market allegory explicitly frames the strategy as one that profits from market pessimism.16 By systematically buying stocks with low P/E and P/BV ratios, the investor is making a bet against the prevailing negative sentiment and assuming that, over time, the price will revert to its higher intrinsic value.22 This is the philosophical opposite of CAN SLIM, which is a trend-following, momentum strategy that bets on the continuation of a prevailing positive trend. A sophisticated screening tool could therefore incorporate a macro-level indicator to suggest which strategy might be more favorable in the current environment. For instance, in the aftermath of a market crash, when fear is high and valuations are compressed, a Graham screen would likely be more effective at identifying opportunities. Conversely, during a stable, established bull market, a CAN SLIM screen might be more fruitful.

## **Section 3: The Hybrid Approach: Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP)**

Positioned between the polar extremes of momentum-growth and deep-value investing is the hybrid strategy known as Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP). This investment approach, famously and successfully employed by legendary Fidelity Magellan Fund manager Peter Lynch, seeks to synthesize the most attractive elements of both philosophies.23 The GARP investor aims to identify companies that exhibit strong and sustainable earnings growth but avoids paying the exorbitant valuation multiples often associated with the most popular growth stocks.25 It is a pragmatic quest for the upside potential of growth, tempered by the valuation discipline of value investing.23

### **3.1 The Core Philosophy of GARP**

The GARP strategy is born from the recognition of the primary pitfalls of both pure growth and pure value investing. It is not, as some critics claim, a "wishy-washy" middle ground, but a distinct methodology with its own set of rigorous criteria.25

* **A Disciplined Approach to Growth:** Pure growth investors are often willing to pay almost any price for a company with a compelling growth story, making them vulnerable to high volatility and severe losses if that growth fails to materialize.26 GARP investors directly address this risk by imposing a strict valuation discipline. They systematically avoid companies where the market's enthusiasm has pushed the stock price to levels that are disconnected from underlying earnings reality.27  

* **An Opportunistic Approach to Value:** Pure value investors, by focusing on statistically cheap metrics, can sometimes fall into "value traps"—stocks that are cheap for a good reason, such as being in a declining industry or having a permanently impaired business model. GARP investors avoid this by explicitly screening for companies with solid growth prospects. They are willing to pay a higher, yet still reasonable, valuation multiple for a company that is expanding its earnings at an above-average rate.26  

* **The Strategic Goal:** By blending these two approaches, the GARP strategy aims to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a full market cycle. While it may underperform a pure growth strategy during the most speculative phases of a bull market, it is designed to provide significantly better downside protection during market corrections and bear markets, ultimately leading to more consistent long-term performance.23

### **3.2 The Central Metric: The Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) Ratio**

The cornerstone of the GARP methodology and the primary tool for its quantitative implementation is the Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio.23 This elegant metric provides a more holistic view of a stock's valuation than the P/E ratio alone by explicitly incorporating the company's expected earnings growth rate into the calculation.26

* Definition and Calculation: The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing a stock's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio by its projected annual earnings per share (EPS) growth rate.

  $$\\text{PEG Ratio} \= \\frac{\\text{P/E Ratio}}{\\text{Annual EPS Growth Rate}}$$

  For example, a company with a P/E ratio of 20 and a projected earnings growth rate of 20% would have a PEG ratio of 1.0 ($20 / 20 \= 1.0$). Another company with the same P/E of 20 but a growth rate of only 10% would have a much less attractive PEG ratio of 2.0 ($20 / 10 \= 2.0$).26  
* **Quantitative Threshold:** A PEG ratio of 1.0 is generally considered to represent fair value, where the stock's valuation multiple is perfectly aligned with its growth prospects. GARP investors typically screen for stocks with a **PEG ratio of 1.0 or less**.26 This simple rule effectively filters for companies whose growth potential has not yet been fully priced in by the market.

### **3.3 A Quantifiable GARP Screen**

While the PEG ratio is the central filter, a comprehensive GARP screen incorporates additional criteria to ensure that the identified companies possess both genuine growth and a reasonable degree of quality and stability. A model screen, such as the one inspired by Peter Lynch's philosophy, would include the following parameters 27:

* **Growth Criteria:**  
  * EPS Growth (Last Quarter vs. Same Quarter Prior Year) $\\geq$ 5.00%  
  * EPS Growth (Trailing Twelve Months vs. Prior TTM) $\\geq$ 10.00%  
  * Projected EPS Growth (This Year vs. Last Year) $\\geq$ 10.00%  
* **Valuation Criteria:**  
  * P/E Ratio (Based on This Year's Estimate) $\\leq$ 15.0  
  * PEG Ratio $\\leq$ 1.0  
* **Liquidity and Viability Criteria:**  
  * Security Price $\\geq$ $5.00  
  * Average 90-Day Volume $\\geq$ 10,000 shares

This combination of criteria systematically excludes both the high-flying growth stocks with excessive valuations and the stagnant, deep-value stocks with subpar growth rates, honing in on the target universe of reasonably priced growers.27

A key distinction of the GARP strategy is its inherently **forward-looking nature**. While Graham's value criteria are based almost entirely on historical, audited financial data (past earnings, book value), and CAN SLIM uses a mix of historical and current market data, GARP is uniquely dependent on *forecasted* earnings growth to calculate the PEG ratio.23 This introduces a critical dependency: the output of a GARP screen is only as reliable as the quality of the earnings estimates used as inputs. If the consensus analyst estimates are overly optimistic or simply wrong, the calculated PEG ratio will be misleading.

This dependency has significant implications for the design of a screening aide. The tool must be integrated with a high-quality, reliable source for consensus analyst earnings estimates. Furthermore, a more sophisticated implementation would not just use the mean estimate but would also provide data on the *dispersion* of those estimates (i.e., the range between the most optimistic and pessimistic forecasts) and the recent *trend* of estimate revisions. A company with a low PEG ratio derived from a tight cluster of upwardly revised estimates is a far more robust candidate than one whose low PEG is based on a wide and downward-trending range of forecasts. This adds a crucial "quality of estimate" dimension to the screening process.

| Dimension | CAN SLIM (O'Neil) | Value (Graham) | GARP (Lynch) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Goal** | Rapid Price Appreciation / Momentum Capture | Capital Preservation / Mean Reversion | Superior Risk-Adjusted Return |
| **Core Metric** | Relative Strength (RS) & EPS Growth | Margin of Safety (Low P/E, P/BV) | PEG Ratio |
| **Time Horizon** | Short-to-Medium Term (Active) | Long Term (Patient) | Full Market Cycle |
| **Ideal Market** | Bull Market / Confirmed Uptrend | Bear Market / Post-Crash Environment | All Markets (Adaptable) |
| **Source of "Edge"** | Timing & Identifying Winners Early | Disciplined Purchase of Undervalued Assets | Balancing Growth Prospects with Valuation |
| **Primary Risk** | Momentum Reversal / High Volatility | Value Trap / Prolonged Stagnation | Inaccurate Growth Forecasts |

## **Section 4: Modern Quantitative Frameworks: An Analysis of Factor-Based Investing**

The evolution of investment theory from named, often heuristic-based strategies like CAN SLIM and Graham's value investing has led to the more systematic and academically rigorous framework of factor-based investing. This modern paradigm deconstructs the returns of a security into the underlying, persistent drivers of risk and return, known as "factors".29 Rather than viewing stocks through the lens of a single, monolithic strategy, factor investing provides a powerful and flexible methodology for understanding precisely *why* certain stocks have historically outperformed others. It allows for the systematization of the very characteristics that earlier strategies sought to capture through more qualitative or rule-of-thumb approaches.31

### **4.1 The Theory of Factor Investing**

The intellectual lineage of factor investing begins with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), developed in the 1960s. CAPM proposed that the expected return of any asset could be explained by a single factor: its sensitivity to overall market movements, or "market beta".32 However, subsequent empirical research found that market beta alone was insufficient to explain the full cross-section of stock returns.

The major breakthrough came in the early 1990s with the work of Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, who introduced their now-famous three-factor model. They demonstrated that, in addition to market beta, two other factors—**Size** (the tendency of small-cap stocks to outperform large-cap stocks) and **Value** (the tendency of stocks with low book-to-market ratios to outperform those with high ratios)—had significant explanatory power over historical returns.30 This multi-factor model laid the foundation for the modern practice of factor investing.32

The persistent outperformance associated with these factors, often referred to as "factor premiums," is generally attributed to one or more of three primary explanations 32:

1. **Risk-Based:** Factor premiums are a rational form of compensation for bearing a specific type of systematic, non-diversifiable risk. For example, value stocks may be more vulnerable to financial distress, and investors demand a higher expected return for bearing that risk.  
2. **Behavioral:** Factor premiums arise from persistent, systematic errors in judgment made by the average investor. The Momentum factor, for instance, is often explained by investors' tendency to initially underreact to positive news, leading to a prolonged upward trend as the information is gradually priced in.  
3. **Structural:** Factor premiums can result from market frictions or institutional constraints. The Size premium, for example, may be partially explained by the lower liquidity and higher transaction costs associated with smaller stocks, or the fact that many large institutions are constrained from investing in them.

Regardless of the underlying cause, the key takeaway is that these factors represent persistent, identifiable characteristics that can be targeted through a systematic, rule-based investment process, thereby removing emotion and subjective bias from portfolio construction.30

### **4.2 A Taxonomy of Key Equity Factors**

While academic literature has identified hundreds of potential factors, a handful have proven to be the most robust and widely accepted in practice. A quantitative screening aide should be built around the capability to measure and rank stocks based on these core factors.

* **Value:** This factor captures the tendency for stocks that are priced cheaply relative to their fundamental value to outperform more expensive stocks over the long term. It is the systematic expression of Graham's core philosophy.  
  * *Common Metrics:* Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B), Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E), Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), Price-to-Cash-Flow (P/CF), and Dividend Yield.29  
* **Momentum:** This factor is based on the observation that stocks which have performed well in the recent past tend to continue performing well in the near future, and vice versa. It is the systematic engine behind O'Neil's 'L' criterion.  
  * *Common Metrics:* 12-month price return, often excluding the most recent month to avoid short-term reversal effects; 6-month price return; Relative Strength vs. the market.29  
* **Quality:** This factor identifies the tendency for companies with strong, stable, and profitable business models to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns. It quantifies the idea of investing in "good businesses."  
  * *Common Metrics:* High Return on Equity (ROE), low Debt-to-Equity ratio, stable and consistent earnings growth, low earnings accruals, and high gross margins.29  
* **Size:** This factor captures the long-term historical tendency for stocks of smaller companies (by market capitalization) to outperform the stocks of larger companies.  
  * *Common Metrics:* Market Capitalization.29  
* **Low Volatility (or Minimum Volatility):** This factor represents the market anomaly where stocks with lower historical volatility have, contrary to traditional finance theory, generated higher risk-adjusted returns than their more volatile counterparts.  
  * *Common Metrics:* Standard deviation of historical daily or weekly returns; Beta.29

Viewing the classic strategies through this modern factor lens is illuminating. Graham's methodology is a clear and deliberate tilt towards the **Value** factor, with secondary considerations for **Quality** (e.g., earnings stability, low debt). The CAN SLIM system is a powerful multi-factor combination, heavily weighted towards **Momentum** (the 'L' and 'N' criteria) and a growth-oriented subset of **Quality** (the 'C' and 'A' criteria). GARP is an explicit attempt to create a balanced multi-factor strategy, seeking stocks that score well on **Quality** (growth) but are not negatively exposed to the **Value** factor (reasonable price).

This deconstruction provides a paradigm shift for the architecture of the proposed screening aide. Instead of creating rigid, hard-coded screens for "CAN SLIM" or "Graham," a far more powerful and flexible approach is to build a **"Factor Composer."** In this design, the user is not limited to predefined recipes but can instead select the underlying factors (ingredients) and assign weights or percentile rank thresholds to create their own custom screens. This transforms the tool from a simple recipe-follower into a sophisticated laboratory for investment strategy construction.

However, a static factor model is not the end of the story. Research and practical experience have shown that factors are cyclical; they experience periods of strong performance and prolonged periods of underperformance.29 For example, the Value factor tends to perform well during economic recoveries, while the Momentum and Quality factors may be more resilient during periods of economic uncertainty.33 This cyclicality suggests that a static allocation to factors may not be optimal.

A truly advanced screening aide could therefore incorporate a **"Factor Regime Model."** This module would analyze key macroeconomic variables—such as the direction of interest rates, inflation expectations, manufacturing indices (PMI), and credit spreads—to provide a probabilistic assessment of which factors are most likely to be in favor in the current economic environment. The screening tool could then use this information to dynamically up-weight or down-weight certain factors in its ranking algorithms, or at least provide the user with contextual guidance on which types of screens are most likely to be fruitful. This elevates the tool from a simple stock-picking device to a dynamic, macro-aware asset allocation assistant.

| Factor | Investment Thesis | Common Quantitative Metrics | Link to Named Strategies |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Value** | Buying assets for less than their intrinsic worth will generate excess returns as prices revert to the mean. | Low P/E, Low P/B, Low P/CF, High Dividend Yield | Graham, GARP |
| **Momentum** | The trend is your friend; recent winners tend to keep winning and losers tend to keep losing in the near term. | 6-12 Month Price Return, Relative Strength vs. Market | CAN SLIM |
| **Quality** | Financially healthy, profitable, stable, and well-managed businesses outperform over the long run. | High ROE, Low Debt/Equity, Stable Earnings Growth | CAN SLIM, GARP |
| **Size** | Smaller companies have greater growth potential and may be overlooked, leading to higher long-term returns. | Market Capitalization | CAN SLIM (implicitly favors smaller, innovative firms) |
| **Low Volatility** | Less risky stocks have historically provided better risk-adjusted returns than more volatile stocks. | Low Standard Deviation of Returns, Low Beta | N/A (Often a standalone defensive strategy) |

## **Section 5: The Alpha Frontier: Integrating Alternative Data for an Informational Edge**

While traditional quantitative analysis relies on structured financial data (e.g., earnings reports, balance sheets) and market data (e.g., price and volume), the frontier of investment analysis is increasingly defined by the integration of "alternative data." These are non-traditional, often unstructured and high-frequency, data sets that can provide a unique and timely informational advantage—or "alpha"—over market participants relying solely on conventional sources.34 The use of alternative data allows for a shift from periodic, backward-looking analysis to a continuous, near real-time monitoring of company performance and economic trends, fundamentally changing the nature of investment research.36

### **5.1 Geospatial Intelligence (Satellites & Geolocation)**

Geospatial data leverages satellite imagery and mobile device location data to translate physical world activity into measurable economic indicators, often providing insights weeks or months ahead of official company reports or government statistics.37

* **Applications & Data Sources:**  
  * **Retail Performance Monitoring:** One of the earliest and most well-known applications is the use of high-resolution satellite imagery to count the number of cars in the parking lots of large retailers like Walmart or Costco. A quantifiable increase or decrease in car counts, when aggregated across hundreds of locations, has been shown to be a reliable leading indicator of quarterly sales figures.38  
  * **Supply Chain and Industrial Activity Tracking:** Geospatial intelligence can monitor the global flow of goods and raw materials. This includes tracking the number of ships entering and leaving ports, measuring the size of raw material stockpiles at mines and factories, and monitoring the storage levels of crude oil in floating-roof tanks to gauge supply and demand dynamics in the energy market.35  
  * **Agricultural Commodity Forecasting:** Satellites equipped with multispectral sensors can assess crop health over vast agricultural regions, allowing analysts to forecast crop yields and their subsequent impact on commodity prices long before official government reports are published.34  
  * **Macroeconomic Analysis:** On a broader scale, changes in nighttime light intensity, as observed from space, have been used as a proxy for economic growth or decline, particularly in developing countries where reliable economic data is scarce.40  
  * **Geolocation Data:** Complementing satellite imagery, anonymized location data from mobile phones provides a highly granular view of consumer foot traffic. This data can be used to measure visits to specific store locations, restaurants, or theme parks, offering direct insight into consumer behavior and brand popularity.36

### **5.2 Textual Analysis (News & Social Media Sentiment)**

Textual analysis employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to extract structured, quantifiable insights from the vast sea of unstructured text generated by news outlets, social media platforms, and other online sources. The collective sentiment expressed in this data can be a powerful leading indicator of shifts in brand perception and market mood.45

* **Applications & Data Sources:**  
  * **Social Media Sentiment:** By analyzing the content and volume of posts on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and StockTwits, it is possible to gauge public opinion about a company or its products in real time. A sudden spike in negative sentiment can be an early warning of a product recall or customer service issue that may later impact the stock price.35 The "meme stock" phenomenon surrounding companies like GameStop, which was driven by discussions on Reddit, is a powerful example of social media's market-moving potential.36  
  * **News Sentiment:** Advanced NLP algorithms can process thousands of financial news articles daily to create a quantitative sentiment score for individual companies or for the economy as a whole (e.g., the Daily News Sentiment Index).45 This provides a data-driven measure of media tone that can be tracked over time.  
  * **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:** More sophisticated techniques go beyond a simple positive/negative score. They can identify the specific *aspects* of a company that are the subject of the sentiment. For example, an algorithm could determine that negative sentiment is specifically related to a new product's high price, while sentiment about the company's customer service remains positive. This level of granularity provides far more actionable intelligence.46

### **5.3 Transactional and Web-Scraped Data Streams**

This category of alternative data provides a direct, real-time measurement of consumer and corporate activity, offering some of the most powerful and predictive signals available.

* **Applications & Data Sources:**  
  * **Credit/Debit Card Transaction Data:** Aggregated and anonymized data from credit and debit card transactions provides a highly accurate, high-frequency measure of a company's sales. For consumer-facing businesses, this data can be used to forecast revenue with a remarkable degree of precision, well in advance of the company's official quarterly earnings release.34  
  * **Email Receipt Data:** Similar to credit card data, information scraped from anonymized email receipts for online purchases offers another valuable stream for tracking real-time sales trends.43  
  * **Web Scraping:** This involves the automated extraction of data from public websites. Applications include tracking job postings on a company's career page (a proxy for growth plans or, conversely, a hiring freeze signaling distress), monitoring product prices on e-commerce sites (to track competitive dynamics or inflation), and aggregating online product reviews (to gauge consumer satisfaction and product success).36  
  * **Corporate Aviation Intelligence:** A niche but powerful data source involves tracking the flights of corporate private jets. A flight from a company's headquarters to that of a potential acquisition target, or to Omaha to meet with Warren Buffett, can be a strong signal of impending M\&A activity or a major investment.44

The integration of these diverse data sources allows for what can be termed the **"quantification of the qualitative."** Many of the classic investment criteria that were once the exclusive domain of discretionary human analysts can now be approximated through quantitative means. For example, the 'N' for "New Product" in the CAN SLIM framework is inherently qualitative. However, its success can be quantitatively tracked in near real-time by monitoring a surge in positive social media mentions, an increase in favorable online reviews, and a spike in web traffic to the new product's landing page.36 Similarly, the abstract concept of "management quality" can be proxied by analyzing workforce analytics data, such as employee sentiment from online reviews and trends in employee turnover rates.39 This capability allows a systematic screening tool to incorporate nuanced, forward-looking insights that were previously difficult to capture in a purely quantitative model.

This shift has profound implications for the architecture of an investment screening aide. The underlying database and data processing pipeline must be designed to handle not just the structured, low-frequency data of financial statements, but also the vast, unstructured, and high-frequency time-series data that characterizes the alternative data landscape. A robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is required to ingest this data, clean it, structure it, and, most importantly, link it accurately to specific company tickers using standardized identifiers like FIGI or CUSIP.51

| Data Category | Specific Data Sources | Investment Insight / Proxy For | Key Use Cases |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Geospatial** | Satellite Imagery (Optical, SAR), Mobile Geolocation (GPS) | Real-world economic and business activity. | Forecasting retail sales, monitoring supply chains, commodity tracking, macroeconomic analysis. |
| **Textual Sentiment** | News Feeds, Social Media (Twitter, Reddit), Product Review Sites | Brand perception, market mood, public opinion. | Event-driven trading, corporate reputation risk management, predicting brand trajectory. |
| **Transactional** | Aggregated Credit/Debit Card Data, E-commerce Email Receipts | Real-time consumer spending and sales trends. | Highly accurate revenue forecasting for consumer-facing companies (retail, restaurants, etc.). |
| **Web Data** | Web Scraping (job postings, pricing), Web Traffic Analytics | Corporate growth/distress, competitive landscape, product interest. | Hiring trend analysis, inflation tracking, gauging online demand. |
| **Corporate Exhaust** | Private Jet Tracking, Patent Filings, Government Contracts | Pre-announcement corporate activity and strategic direction. | M\&A prediction, tracking innovation pipelines, identifying key government suppliers. |

## **Section 6: Synthesis / Architectural Recommendations for a Multi-Strategy Screening Aide**

The preceding analysis has deconstructed several distinct yet interconnected investment methodologies, from the classic, rule-based systems of O'Neil and Graham to the modern, systematic frameworks of factor investing and alternative data analysis. This concluding section synthesizes these findings into a coherent set of architectural and strategic recommendations for the development of a powerful, flexible, and future-proof quantitative screening aide. The objective is to move beyond a simple collection of disparate screens and propose an integrated system that supports a complete workflow from idea generation to final validation.

### **6.1 The Core Architectural Philosophy: Modularity and Composability**

A foundational recommendation is to build the screening aide upon a modular architecture rather than as a series of monolithic, hard-coded screens. The system should treat individual investment criteria—such as P/E ratio, Relative Strength, or ROE—as discrete "building blocks" or "factors." This approach, directly informed by the principles of factor investing, recognizes that classic strategies like CAN SLIM and GARP are, in essence, predefined combinations of these underlying factors. A modular, composable design allows a user to perfectly replicate these classic strategies by selecting the appropriate blocks. More importantly, it empowers the user to move beyond replication and create novel, hybrid strategies tailored to their own unique investment theses—for instance, a "Quality at a Reasonable Price" screen that combines top-quartile Quality factors with a strict PEG ratio filter. This transforms the tool from a rigid recipe book into a creative culinary workshop.

### **6.2 A Proposed Three-Layered Screening Process**

To manage complexity and provide a logical user workflow, the screening process can be structured in three distinct layers:

1. **Layer 1: The Universe Filter:** This is the initial, broad-stroke filtering stage where non-negotiable, baseline criteria are applied to the entire universe of stocks. This layer would include essential screens for minimum liquidity (e.g., average daily trading volume greater than 1 million shares 9), a minimum market capitalization to exclude micro-caps, and exchange listing requirements. Critically, this layer should also incorporate the 'M' (Market Direction) criterion from CAN SLIM, allowing it to function as a master "risk-on/risk-off" switch for the entire system. When the market is in a confirmed downtrend, this filter could be activated to restrict the output to only the most defensive candidates or to signal a cash-heavy portfolio stance.6  
2. **Layer 2: The Factor Ranking Engine:** This is the analytical core of the system. In this layer, every stock that passes through the universe filter is scored and ranked across the comprehensive set of factors identified in the preceding analysis (Value, Momentum, Quality, Size, Low Volatility, etc.). This engine would continuously calculate and update the relevant metrics—such as RS rating, P/E ratio, debt-to-equity, and ROE—for every security in the universe, creating a rich, multi-dimensional data matrix.  
3. **Layer 3: The Strategy Composer & Qualitative Dashboard:** This is the interactive user interface layer where the raw analytical power of Layer 2 is harnessed.  
   * **Strategy Composer:** This interface allows the user to select factors from the ranking engine, define thresholds (e.g., P/E \< 15), set percentile ranks (e.g., top 10% on Momentum), and assign weights to create a fully customized screening model. For ease of use, it would also include pre-configured templates that instantly load the parameters for classic "CAN SLIM," "Graham," and "GARP" screens.  
   * **Qualitative Dashboard:** Once a screen is run and a shortlist of candidates is generated, this dashboard provides the crucial next step of analysis. For any selected stock, it would present the "softer" and alternative data points needed for deeper validation. This includes visualizing news and social media sentiment trends over time, displaying recent insider trading activity, charting the change in institutional ownership, and flagging relevant alternative data signals such as spikes in web traffic or anomalous satellite imagery readings.

### **6.3 Handling Conflicting Signals and Strategy Integration**

A system built on diverse factors will inevitably produce conflicting signals. A stock may rank in the 95th percentile for Momentum but the 5th percentile for Value. This is not a system flaw but a feature that reveals the stock's character. The screening aide should be designed to visualize these trade-offs. For example, a 2x2 matrix plotting stocks on a Value axis and a Momentum axis can be a powerful tool. This would allow users to instantly identify "Deep Value" stocks (high value, low momentum), "High Flyers" (high momentum, low value), potential "Value Traps" (low on both), and the coveted "Sweet Spot" of stocks that are beginning to exhibit improving momentum from a low valuation base. The GARP framework, and the PEG ratio specifically, can serve as a natural mediator in the ranking engine, systematically balancing the conflicting signals from pure growth and pure value factors.

### **6.4 The Data Infrastructure Imperative**

The success of this project will be determined as much by the robustness of its data pipeline as by the sophistication of its analytical engine. The back-end architecture must be designed to ingest, clean, time-stamp, and link a wide array of data types—structured financials, semi-structured market data, and unstructured alternative data—to unique and persistent company identifiers.51 Given the rapid evolution of the alternative data landscape and the potential for signal decay as sources become more widely known, the system must be built for adaptability. A "plugin" architecture for data sources is recommended. This would allow for the efficient integration of new, novel data sets and the deprecation of older ones, ensuring the tool remains at the cutting edge and maintains its informational advantage over time.

Ultimately, the vision for this project should extend beyond that of a simple "screening aide." The synthesis of these methodologies points toward the creation of an integrated **"Idea Generation to Validation" Engine.** This is a system that supports the entire quantitative research workflow. A user can begin by forming a hypothesis (e.g., "In the current economic regime, high-quality companies with improving momentum are likely to outperform"). They can then use the Strategy Composer to build a screen that systematically identifies a portfolio of stocks matching this thesis. Finally, they can use the Qualitative Dashboard to validate the thesis with high-frequency, alternative data signals (e.g., "Are these selected companies showing increasing web traffic? Is social media sentiment positive?"). This elevates the project from a tool that merely provides a list of stocks to a comprehensive quantitative research and decision-support platform.
