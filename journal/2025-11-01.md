### Preliminaries

The level of information processing or knowledge management power available as tools for an individual to use for a given amount of money is increasing by a factor of 10 every 5 years.  This approximation of a long-term historical trend started at least 150 years ago, long before computers or what we think of when it comes to information technology because it combines multiple different facets, including not only the computational power of moving from mechanical tabulators or moving from telegraph or wire services to internetworked computing but the network effects of a more well-informed public, especially in the ranks of those commit investment capital or technical professionals who implement new technlogies based on scientific discoveries. 

Do not let people tell you that the 10X per 5 year or 60% gain per year is all about Moore's Law or the gains in FLOPs per dollar for ML-specific GPUs has doubled every two years or other things that have been faster than the longer-term historical trend in information processing or knowledge management power. Traditional Moore's Law (doubling transistor count every two years) has slowed down to closer to every three years but there are other hardware, algorithmic and software advances which are now increasingly enabled by much larger network effects than any company or visionary or prognosticator can predict.  

It's no longer a *Steve Jobs- or Elon Musk- or pick-your-favorite-individual-visionary-driven* kind of world ... the continued multiplication of information processing or knowledge management power is not about what happens in any set of labs of individual company or even just one about one particularly dynamic segment of the economy. It's not just that network effects matter, it's maybe mostly about how more contributors are using increasingly interconnected parts of the network. The value of any isolated network increases as more people use it (Metcalfe's Law suggests the value is proportional to the square of the number of users), but things like open-weight AI models for better search capabilities and more efficient software for really BIG data are rapidly lowering the barriers to much advanced information processing and search, making powerful recommendation and filtering technologies accessible to more individuals or companies without much if any need for massive personal investment.

The combination of exponential improvements across ranges of networked knowledge management systems, along with price-performance of affordable, ubiquitous information technology ... ***never mind the latest, greatest bleeding-edge new gadget or AI hype!!!*** ... means that individuals who focus first on the immense leverage gained from networked information resources driving the "10x every 5 years" or 60% per year improvement can gain immensely by using what works, ie it's about fifth-, fourth-, third- or late second-mover advantage ... using the big ideas that somebody else has come up with ... not just in AI, or GPUs or compute and most definitely NOT in the realm of expensive, over-priced shiny new stuff -- but across the board in the FULL range of knowledge flowing from scientific research and development.

Of course, the immense and growing productivity of knowledgement management systems is also extremely well-understood by criminals, charlatans and tyrants who leverage the power of crowdliness. More than ever, the average citizen cannot afford to be naive. The corrosive, destructive power of crime, misplaced faith and networked intolerance is worse than ever and getting worse. Evil is still evil ... it's NOT the technology, eg guns don't jump off tables or take themselves out of cabinets and go on shooting sprees -- imagining something like "AI is evil!" is the best way to make it certain that AI is used for evil purposes.

Particularly in the realm of personal knowledge management technologies, **self-defense has to be seen as an OBLIGATION**, it's not something that one can afford to be disinterested in ... especially when becoming knowledgable about some especially powerful aspect of self-defense is imagined to be the kind of thing that one can ignore, because *nerds, technicians or some nasty thugs is hired to do the dirty work* ... nothing empowers evil more than turning away from it while it is on the march.
