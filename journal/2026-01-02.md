### PERSONAL Minimalist Living and Basic Needs

As we look forward to a New Year, it's a good time to reflect on what truly matters and, accordingly, set the budget for the coming year ... especially since budgeting helps one PRIORITIZE what actually matters. 

It really does not require very much money to live an extremely satisfying, meaningful life ... money spent on living which must come from somewhere, either income from work, income from investments/savings ... or Social Security benefits that reflect the deductions that I never thought would actually materialize during my lifetime of work.

If I were going to be working as serious fulltime professional, it'd be NECESSARY for me to migrate to where employers actually paid people something ... on the other hand, if I am working as an aspiring author or open source developer, I can live whereever I want to live. It's completely unnecessary to for me to migrate somewhere where housing is expensive and/or in a crime-riddled area where my personal safety is compromised so it's perfectly fine for me to live somewhere where life is almost boringly simple and tediously safe, but one does need a basic level utilities and there are property taxes and insurance to pay for ... $7500/year should cover housing/utilities for me, ie it's mostly driven by property taxes and covering the MINIMUMS, eg basic meter charge, on utilty hookups, although my insurance plan is there to covers large catestrophic losses, even modest amounts of property damage, eg paying for an arborist to remove a large downed tree, can turn expensive in a hurry when we experience damage from high winds or flooding ... food in America is really extremely cheap if one just focuses on nutrients and quality, although higher quality foods still do cost something, although $4000/year should be more than sufficient, as long as I take garden really seriously, primarily for outdoor/nature enjoyment and exercise, but also to give extra variety to my diet ... it's generally much cheaper for me to focus on pushing my recreation and entertainment needs toward enjoying training in the martial arts/yoga, gardening and diet, and I should focus even more on improving my cardio, breathwork and sleep hygiene than to worry much on healthcare or doctors visits -- it doesn't take much; $2500 per year is more sufficient, but the strong push here must be FOCUSED on improving my level of fitness and body awareness rather than spending anything on doctors visits, lab work, or supplements/pharma ... since I walk everywhere that I need to go, it is completely unnecessary to spend very much at all on transportation, ie one is better off walking; $1000/year should be more than sufficient for my infrequent transport/travel needs, but ideally I would NEVER need to spend anything or travel anywhere because life gets really expensive, much more uncertain, and generally more complicated and tougher to figure out in hurry when one's imagines that one needs to travel ... the total budget for my mininalist lifestyle in 2026 is roughly $15,000 per year OR about $16,500 per year if I want to add in a modest buffer for unexpected expenses or emergencies or charities if I don't have those kinds of expenses or emergencies.

$16,500 for 2026 gives me what I consider to be a very comfortable lifestyle, perhaps even too comfortable, ie I have been living on less.  I would guess that most people in America could not bring themselves to live in the minimalist manner that I do. After all, my budgeted amount for 2026is less than HALF of what the average American will spend in this coming year. *But it's not even as minimalist as I could make it if I chose to work on being extremely ascetic.*

### US Per Capita Consumer Expenditures (2024 Data)

The most reliable and detailed breakdown of typical or average per capita household spending in the US comes from the **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE)** for 2024. We should expect a MODERATE increase in spending in 2025 and 2026 due to inflationary pressures, but the overall proportions across categories should remain relatively stable ... the 2026 number could safely be assumed to be roughly 5% higher than 2024. We should expect some deflationary pressures on some things, particularly on non-essentials that can enhance our productivity/enjoyment, like perhaps computer memory [since it's currently still overpriced] ... but we can't take advantage of unexpected future bargains if we spend in ways in which we run out of money before the ends of months, so we should always be attempting to spend less than our budgeted amounts -- so that we are able to enjoy the benefits of price reductions when they occur.

In 2024, the average annual expenditures per **consumer unit** (roughly equivalent to a household) were **$78,535**.

To arrive at **per capita** figures (per person), we divide by the average consumer unit size of approximately **2.4 persons** (based on recent BLS averages: around 2.5 in prior years, adjusted slightly downward in recent trends).

This gives an approximate **per capita annual expenditure** of **$32,700**.

Below is a detailed breakdown of major categories using BLS 2024 percentage shares applied to this per capita total. These represent average out-of-pocket spending by US consumers.

#### Notes on Key Categories
- **Housing**: The largest category, including shelter (rent or imputed rent for owners), utilities (electricity, gas, water), and furnishings. Utilities alone typically account for about 6-7% of total housing spending (roughly **$1,800–$2,200 per household** or **$750–$900 per capita**).
- **Food**: Split roughly between food at home (~8%) and food away from home (~5%).
- **Healthcare**: Primarily out-of-pocket costs (premiums paid by households, copays, etc.). Total US health spending is much higher (~$13,000–$14,000 per capita when including employer/government contributions), but this is household direct spending.
- **Utilities**: Embedded in housing; separate detailed estimates from BLS sub-tables show ~$4,000–$4,500 per household annually.
- **Education**: Mostly private tuition, fees, and supplies (public K-12 is tax-funded, not out-of-pocket).

These figures are averages across all US households and reflect 2024 data released in late 2025. Spending varies significantly by income, age, region, and household size—higher-income households spend more absolutely but similar proportions in many categories.

For national accounts perspective (BEA Personal Consumption Expenditures), total PCE in 2024 was approximately **$19.9 trillion**, with a US population of ~341 million, yielding ~**$58,300 per capita** total consumption (including imputed values like employer-paid health insurance and financial services). However, the BLS data above better matches direct household "expenditures" as typically understood.
