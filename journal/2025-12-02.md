# 100 SMARTER gamechangers for podcasting from the last few years

I contend that the most important language, technology, skill that is ***vitally necessary*** for programming information technology is a hard-driven curiosity about what one is missing and a need to explore what is happening in the rest of the world ... of course, it's AI-assisted, but the MOST important aspect of it is not AI at all, but rather humility ... humility is NECESSARY, because EGO IS THE ENEMY when you're living in a world in which there's always somebody, somewhere else who is approaching the problem from a completely different angle and is finding a better way than you can imagine.

So one's awareness of what others are up to is never ever sufficient ... as one becomes more aware of what others are up to, one becomes even more aware of how tiny one's awareness is ... if one is *doing it right*, one feels more and more and more humble ... only through humility can a person develop the HARD ***discipline*** of having a hard-driven curiosity about how one can more rapidly and practically improve in some endeavor ... so at some point, this DISCIPLINE must involve some pain ... the kind of pain that comes from actually putting what one has learned to practice and developing a hands-on skinned knuckles aggravation-intensive understanding of how things work ... but MOSTLY, this is about finding JOY and GRATITUDE through greater curiosity ... and partly, this is about generally avoiding people who lack curiosity or fail to work at the DISCIPLINE of **practical, applied** curiosity.

Podcastering is simply one of many, many, many examples ... but it's a useful example.

This quickie-curated list is from prompting SuperGrok to generate a list of 100 ways that podcasting has significantly changed in the last year or five years because of the rise in availability of AI-related services and technologies and savviness, beyond GEO and AIO. In asking for a DETAILED list of 100 different items, I am really commanding SuperGrok to PUSH DOWN into the technical details and give me a list more suitable for an expert than a noob.  I direct SuperGrok to ensure each item on the list of 100 has a description that gives me four distinct, separate bullet points which serve to describe the item in much more sufficient detail, to promote my understanding as I look at the entire list. Each group of four bullet points must include at least one URL so that the list of 100 also serves up 100 jumping off points. It is fine if there are more, but not required that the group of four bullet points includes more than just one URL.
