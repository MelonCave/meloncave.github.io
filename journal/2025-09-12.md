## Thinking Through ALL of the Modules In Five Phases of GitHub Projects

Laying out all of these modules as individual issues IS relatively tedious ... and exhausting, if one really does any diligent investigation of the modules as one puts them into the Project Roadmap ... but that is necessary in order to really get a sense of the overall program and to start getting one's head wrapped around how the phases will proceed and to ask questions about how the program can be improved. Certainly improvements will be possible, but there are many facets of this, eg like getting Python environments and summarization scripts working are just sort of important to think through ... even though one can now use AI-assistance to overcome many of the simplistic errors that would have formerly stopped someone not well versed in dev skills.
