[How can we be better disciples of Christ?](https://gemini.google.com/share/5a41eebe1555) ... being a better disciple of Christ is entirely about **IMITITATING Christ** in terms of developing the disciplines that lead to Christ-like Strength, Service, Humility. Developing personal knowledge management and engineering (PKM/PKE) is ultimately about using developing the proficiency in information technology and PKM/PKE tools of transformative discipleship technology (TDT) ... not to make the proficiency in technology the end, but rather to use TDT to assist us in develops these Christ-like disciplines Strength, Service, Humility in a PRACTICAL way.

How do we PRACTICALLY **develop the small disciplines with each waking moment that result in STRENGTH**, the discipline of walking, doing things, exercising to getting stronger, rather than sitting around moping or worrying or being entertained?  But actually, strength is sort of easy ... it's a lot tougher be of genuine **SERVICE** to others.

How do we PRACTICALLY **develop the small disciplines with each waking moment that result in the capacity to be of real service**, the discipline of listening, understanding, not doing things for people but helping them to be able to help themselves so that they are independent and don't need us to do things for them, RATHER THAN jumping in to help them with what we think they need, writing checks, swooping in with chainsaws and heavy equipment to clean up disasters? What is it about our egomaniacal human nature that makes us want to be the white knight, the hero, the savior, the one with all the answers, rather than being humble servants who LISTEN, seek first to UNDERSTAND, to help others deal with their issues and help themselves? Don't we know that the guy with the all of the answers is always the one who is creating more problems than he is solving?

How do we PRACTICALLY **develop the small disciplines with each waking moment that result in HUMILITY**, RATHER THAN acting as if we are some omniscient God, can we actually recognize our own limitations, weaknesses, and our own NEED for growth and change -- why is it so necessary for humans to be so prideful, arrogant, needing to have all of the answers, all the solutions, to be the judge of good and evil?

The POINT of personal knowledge management and engineering, (PKM/PKE) is to help me to develop the advanced levels of disciplines of STRENGTH, SERVICE, and HUMILITY in my daily life. 

The whole point of KNOWLEDGE is not about having answers or the abiliy to rapidly fix something -- the point of knowledge to be able to APPRECIATE the blessing of the Creator and to ask better, deeper, more insightful questions ... because, active listening or LISTENING better is not about having answers, but rather is about THINKING first, to genuinely UNDERSTAND better ... if I genuine want to be SERVICE to others, I need to **be humble to the point of being anonymous.** 

The most sincere form of adoration is imitation of Christ, not replication -- the [most basic need of any human being is to feel capable, maybe needed](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/256321/jewish/Eight-Degrees-of-Giving.htm). People who have become truly self-sufficient and able to re-establish self-sufficiency... if they have given away all of their assets or maybe lost everything and has rebuilt ... understands why they don't engage in checkbook charity or idiot compassion -- they know that they must aspire to anonymously help others develop the discipline to become self-sufficient. The most sincere form of adoration is imitation of Christ, not replication ... IMITATING Christ demands constantly praying that the will of God be done and that the Holy Spirit guide our actions, but it also demands perfect humility and anonymity.

It's not JUST that Jesus Christ has already been Jesus Christ, not just that Christ is perfect and, as such, there's no need for a replicate savior ... there us a NEED for perfect anonymity, to give all of the glory of our actions to God. When I seek to imitate him or spend time thinking about the mysteries of Christ, I might understand that there's absolutely no need to *replicate* Him or even replicate His actions, but there's still a human tendency to rush in like some fool to be the superhero in a cape or worse to rush in with a big checkbook and bail out some individual or charitable organization. In fact, that's profoundly WRONG in how it undermines humility! 

It's not up to me to be the savior or healer or celebrity who people seek out to cure their self-induced leprosy and constant deprivation of their soul from bathing in the materialist filth of the world and consuming the prograndized need for more, still more and then even more stuff ... with better knowledge, I can ANONYMOUSLY step in to guide things without recieving any credit, efficiently stopping situations from escalating before they really start or ideally shrinking the target-rich environment to eliminate the opportunity for situations to arise ... rather than being a know-it-all or miraculous billionaire who creates more problems by advocating a vehicle or an appliance or spaceship to escape junked up existences on Earth or invents some other costly piece of junk technology that people don't need, can't afford, and that ultimately just distracts them from the real work of self-improvement and becoming what their Creator intended them to be.

# **Imitating Christ: Strength, Service, Humility**

An authentic Christian vision of influence in the world is built upon profound paradoxes of Christ-like life. The dominion of Christiandom is found in the kinds of power that find their ultimate expression not in domination, but in service; strength that is perfected in weakness; and exaltation that is achieved through humility. 

This framework introduces the concept of the "[Cruciform](https://cruciformlife.wordpress.com/2008/08/15/what-is-the-cruciform-life/) Scepter"—a metaphor for a life lived, shaped by the cross, striving toward a form of self-control or authority and power over our desires, that is modeled on the self-giving, servant-hearted sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. The assertion that a Christian people or nation should be simultaneously the most humble and the most powerful is not a contradiction but a deep theological truth. It suggests that a robust faith requires far more than simple piety, perhaps even eschews piety in some contexts; it demands a dynamic synthesis of profound humility, strategic wisdom, practical competence, and an unwavering commitment to justice and service RATHER THAN APPLAUSE OR ACCOLADES. 

This report ATTEMPTS TO provide a systematic, scripturally-grounded exploration of the foundations of this paradigm ... but the report is totally inadequate -- *the proof is in the pudding* it's not about a document or book or library of the best collected works of humankind -- it's about simple LIVED life, attempting to be a humble example that demonstrating how the constant faith-filled awareness of human insufficiency is the very foundation upon which divine power, sanctified competence, and effective, loving service are built.

## **Section I: The Foundation of Insufficiency: Humility as the Prerequisite for Divine Power**

The journey toward genuine spiritual authority begins not with a declaration of strength, but with the honest confession of its absence ... FIRST, we must admit that we are not God ... we are not the judges of who goes to heaven or hell ... we are not the arbiters of the divine wisdom underpinning the judgement of the Lord ... when we say, "Vengeance is mine, says the Lord", it means that we don't make the rules for others -- we don't preach our version of the rules; we simply try to be the best imitation of Christ that we can be, as imperfect, fallible beings -- but we are not the authority.

The acknowledgment that one can never be a sufficiently good imitation of Jesus Christ is not a statement of despair but the **essential starting point** for beginning to understand how we might access divine power. This foundational humility is the act of emptying a vessel so that it may be filled with a power that is not its own.

### **1.1 The Universal Diagnosis: The Reality of Human Imperfection**

Biblical theology establishes the universal reality of human sinfulness as the baseline condition for ***all*** humanity. This is not intended to induce paralyzing guilt, but to foster a sober realism that eradicates any basis for self-righteousness. The Preacher in Ecclesiastes states this plainly: “Surely there is no righteous man on earth who does good and never sins”. The Apostle Paul echoes this in his letter to the Romans, declaring that “***all*** have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” ... but, it is of no use whatsoever for us to claim that ALL have sinned -- we are personally responsible for OUR OWN sins, not the sins or happiness or conduct of others.

These verses provide a definitive theological diagnosis that levels the ground before God. To deny this reality is to engage in a profound self-deception. The Apostle John warns that if we claim to be without sin, “we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us,” a posture that effectively calls God a liar. Conversely, the acknowledgment of this truth is the very act that initiates divine action. It is only when one agrees with God about this condition that one is positioned to receive His cleansing and forgiveness. This establishes a direct and unbreakable link between honest self-assessment and divine grace.

### **1.2 The Divine Response: God's Opposition to Pride and Favor to the Humble**

God’s posture toward humanity is not one of passive observation; it is a dynamic interaction that actively resists pride and extends grace to the humble. This principle is one of the most consistently repeated maxims in scripture, appearing in both the Old and New Testaments: “God opposes the proud but shows favor or gives grace to the humble”. The verb translated as “opposes” is the Greek term *antitassomai*, a military word meaning to arrange in battle against. Pride, therefore, is not merely a character flaw; it is actually a declaration of war against our Creator, placing an individual in direct opposition to His power and purpose.  

Humility, in stark contrast, aligns a person with the flow of divine grace. Jesus illustrated this dynamic in his parable of the wedding feast, where guests who chose the places of honor were ultimately humiliated, while the one who humbly took the lowest place was exalted by the host. This spiritual law is immutable: self-exaltation leads to abasement, while self-humbling leads to exaltation. A national posture of strength must, paradoxically, begin with a collective posture of profound insufficiency before God, as seen in His promise to Israel: “if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray... then I will hear from heaven”. Humility is thus revealed not as a pious affectation but as the foundational strategic decision from which all other forms of legitimate power flow.

### **1.3 The Christological Model: The Humility of the Incarnation**

The ultimate exemplar of humble power is Jesus Christ himself. The Apostle Paul, in his letter to the Philippians, provides the theological core of this principle. He commands believers to do nothing from selfish ambition but to “in humility value others above yourselves”. He immediately pivots from this command to the supreme model: Christ Jesus, “Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant... he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!”  

This passage, often referred to as the *kenosis* hymn (from the Greek for "self-emptying"), is the bedrock of Christian ethics and theology of power. It demonstrates that for God Himself, the path to ultimate exaltation and authority was paved with radical self-renunciation and service. This act irrevocably links true greatness not with command and control, but with servanthood and sacrifice. Any pursuit of Christian power that bypasses the pattern of the cross is, by definition, not Christian.

### **1.4 The Apostolic Paradox: Strength Perfected in Weakness**

The Apostle Paul’s personal testimony serves as a practical, lived-out application of the Christological model. Plagued by a "thorn in my flesh," Paul pleaded with the Lord for its removal. The divine response he received reframed his entire understanding of power: “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness”.  

This revelation transformed Paul’s perspective. Instead of lamenting his limitations, he began to see them as the very arena where God’s power could be most clearly displayed. His conclusion was revolutionary: “Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me... For when I am weak, then I am strong”. This moves the discussion from abstract principle to lived reality. Acknowledging personal and collective insufficiency is not a passive state of resignation but an active strategy for accessing divine power. The desire for strength and competence is thus shown to be achievable only through the counterintuitive embrace of weakness and a radical dependence on God.

## **Section II: The Mandate for Excellence: Acquiring Sanctified Wisdom and Competence**

The foundation of humility does not lead to passivity or mediocrity. Rather, it is is a lot tougher than any sort of superhero routine. The HIGHEST form of agency is about practicing the necessary exercises in spiritual posture for the pursuit of genuine excellence. The call for shrewd empathy, intelligence, and practical competence is a spiritual mandate—a form of stewardship over the intellectual and relational faculties endowed by the Creator ... and it is an act of worship that demands that we are never satisfied, never good enough, never worthy of accolades ... it can be thought of being driven to be like Peter [as depicted visually in Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio's 1601 painting] as Peter asked to be crucified upside down, feeling unworthy to die in the same manner as his Lord, nailed to the cross, lifting our gaze toward heaven and attempting to exhibit spiritual strength and steadfast faith, with God rather than fear or agony alone.

### **2.1 The Fount of All Knowledge: Wisdom's Divine Origin**

True wisdom is not a human invention but a divine attribute that God desires to impart to those who seek it. The book of Proverbs declares, “For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding”. This principle is carried into the New Testament, where James encourages believers, “If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you”.  

The quest for wisdom is therefore not an independent human project but a dependent one. The foundational maxim of this pursuit is that “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge”. This reverent awe and humility, established in the previous section, is the very key that unlocks the door to true understanding. It properly orients the seeker to the source of all truth, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from curdling into arrogant folly.

### **2.2 From Abstract to Applied: God-Given Skills for God-Given Tasks**

Biblical wisdom is intensely practical, manifesting as tangible skills, artistic ability, and administrative competence. It is not confined to philosophical or religious matters. In the Old Testament, when the tabernacle needed to be constructed, God explicitly “filled” its chief artisans, Bezalel and Oholiab, “with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills”. This divine endowment covered everything from metalwork and engraving to weaving and design. Later, when King Solomon ascended the throne, he did not ask God for wealth or long life, but for “wisdom and knowledge” to properly govern the people. God was so pleased with this request that He granted it enthusiastically, along with the riches and honor Solomon had not sought.  

These narratives sanctify the pursuit of practical excellence. Competence in craftsmanship, leadership, justice, and administration is presented not as a "secular" endeavor separate from faith, but as a direct gift from God for the fulfillment of His purposes on earth. Developing and deploying these skills becomes an act of worship. It provides a powerful theological basis for building competencies and striving to be "hard-working, powerful... advanced and getting more advanced" not as an act of pride, but as an act of faithful stewardship over God-given potential.

### **2.3 The Discerning Heart: Strategic Wisdom in a Fallen World**

The call for "shrewd empathy" and "intelligence gathering" translates directly into the biblical categories of discernment and prudence. Living effectively in a complex and often hostile world requires more than naive goodwill. Jesus himself commanded his disciples to be “wise as serpents and innocent as doves” as they went out into the world. This is a call for sanctified shrewdness—an astute understanding of human nature and worldly systems, paired with a commitment to moral purity.  

The Apostle Paul builds on this, instructing the Colossians to “Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time... so that you may know how you ought to answer each person”. This is a direct mandate for situational awareness and relational intelligence. Proverbs defines the wisdom of the prudent as the ability “to discern his way”. This involves the capacity to understand people, motives, and situations with deep insight in order to navigate challenges effectively and righteously. It is the application of godly knowledge to real-world problems.

### **2.4 Beyond "Idiot Compassion": Love Tempered by Knowledge**

The concept of "idiot compassion," as articulated by Chögyam Trungpa, describes a well-intentioned desire to do good that is not guided by intelligence and is therefore often ineffective or even harmful. This idea finds a striking parallel in scripture. Paul’s prayer for the Philippians was not simply that their love would grow, but that their “love may abound more and more, *with knowledge and all discernment*, so that you may approve what is excellent”.  

True Christian love is not a blind, sentimental feeling. It is robust, discerning, and intelligent. Compassion without competence can lead to enablement, wasted resources, and unintended negative consequences. A truly loving response must be deeply empathetic while also being wise about what is genuinely right, beautiful, just, and helpful. It requires the very intelligence, discernment, and competence that scripture commends, ensuring that the desire to help is channeled into actions that produce real and lasting good.

## **Section III: The Purpose of Power: Stewardship for Service, Justice, and Protection**

Having established humility as the foundation for power and excellence as its necessary expression, the analysis now turns to its ultimate purpose, or *telos*. Biblical power is never an end in itself. It is a tool, a trust from God. Its legitimacy is determined solely by its application toward the goals of selfless service, the establishment of justice, and the protection of the vulnerable.

### **3.1 The Paradigm of Power: Not to Be Served, but to Serve**

The foundational principle for all Christian use of power was articulated by Jesus Christ. In response to his disciples’ argument about who was the greatest, He declared, “For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many”. This statement completely inverts the world’s model of power, which sees authority as a means of commanding service from others.  

Christian power is of [cruciform shape](https://cruciformlife.wordpress.com/2008/08/15/what-is-the-cruciform-life/), meaning that our lives are shaped by cross, in imitation of Christ's life and sacrifice -- reflecting the self-giving love, humility, and suffering of Jesus Christ. It is directed outward and downward in service to others. Jesus reinforced this by teaching that “The greatest among you will be your servant”. All competencies, skills, influence, and strength acquired by a believer or a believing community must be channeled through this paradigm. The operational command is to “value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others”. **Power is thus redefined as an expanded capacity for service to those legitimately in need.**

### **3.2 The Mandate for Justice: The Non-Negotiable Prophetic Call**

Christian service is not a passive activity; it must include the active, and often confrontational, pursuit of justice. The prophetic voice of the Old Testament is clear and demanding on this point. The prophet Micah distills the Lord’s requirement for humanity into a powerful triad: “To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God”. This is not a multiple-choice list; all three are required. Justice without mercy becomes tyranny, mercy without justice becomes enablement, and both without humility become self-righteous pride.  

Isaiah provides a specific action plan for this mandate: “Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow’s cause”. This is the active, outward expression of the discerning compassion discussed previously. It involves using one’s power, influence, and competence to defend those who cannot defend themselves and to reorder unjust social structures. A righteous person is defined in Proverbs not by their personal piety alone, but by the fact that they “know the rights of the poor”.

### **3.3 A Theology of Protection: The "Solid Defense Capability"**

The call for a "solid defense capability" can be understood within a theological framework of ***protecting the vulnerable and maintaining a just order.*** While Christian ethics prioritizes peace, scripture also provides a basis for the legitimate use of force by governing authorities to restrain evil and protect the innocent. The Apostle Paul in Romans 13 describes the state as “God’s servant,” an authority that “does not bear the sword for no reason” but acts as “an **agent of wrath** to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.” Of course, this ability to wield force is not something that automatically happens; it is a responsibility that of citizens to be fit, strong, and competent enough to either contribute to the defense of the community when called upon, or at minimim, not be cowardly demanders of protection by those who are willing to do the nasty work of serving, protecting, defending.

From a Christian perspective, a defense capability is not for conquest or national aggrandizement but for the creation of a secure space where justice, mercy, and human flourishing can occur. Its legitimacy is tied directly to its purpose: defending the innocent and upholding righteousness, which is an extension of the biblical command to care for the “weak and the fatherless” and maintain the “right of the afflicted and the destitute”. This power must always be wielded with the humble awareness of Micah 6:8, constantly checking its actions against the standards of justice, mercy, and ultimate accountability to God.

### **3.4 The Practice of Service: The Good Works Prepared by God**

The high ideals of justice and service are ultimately grounded in concrete, daily actions. Believers are described as “God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do”. These are not abstract intentions but tangible expressions of faith.  

This involves practical actions such as sharing resources with those in need , practicing hospitality , bearing one another's burdens , and faithfully using one's unique gifts to serve others. The competencies developed through wisdom and hard work find their ultimate and most noble expression in meeting the real-world needs of others, from the personal to the systemic.

## **Section IV: The Character of the Witness: An Attractive and Accountable Example**

The synthesis of humility, competence, and service creates a distinct character of witness in the world. This lived reality is meant to be a public demonstration—an "attractive" example that holds both itself and others accountable to a higher standard of living, not through judgment, but through inspiration.

### **4.1 The Mandate to Model: Becoming an Imitator of Christ**

The Christian life is not intended to be a private affair but a public model. The Apostle Paul was remarkably bold in his exhortations, telling the Corinthian church, “Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ” , and urging the Philippians to “join in following my example”. This was not a claim to personal perfection but a confident appeal to the pattern of Christ visible in his life.  

This mandate is passed down to all leaders. The elder Paul instructs the younger Timothy to “set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity”. He gives similar instructions to Titus, telling him to be a “model of good works” characterized by “integrity, dignity, and sound speech that cannot be condemned”. The Greek word for example, *tupos*, carries the idea of a die or a mold—a prototype from which copies are made. The life of humble potency is meant to be this master pattern for others to follow.

### **4.2 Salt and Light: Influence Through Godly Distinction**

The "attractiveness" of a Christian witness stems not from conforming to worldly standards of charisma, but from a compelling distinction. Jesus used the metaphors of salt and light to describe his followers' influence in the world. Salt preserves and adds flavor, while light dispels darkness and illuminates truth. The purpose of this distinctiveness is explicit: “let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven”.  

The "good deeds" are the tangible outcomes of the integrated life described in the previous sections. In a world often characterized by pride, incompetence, injustice, and self-interest, a community marked by humility, excellence, mercy, and selfless service stands in stark, compelling contrast. This lived reality becomes the most persuasive argument for the faith. It is an attractive witness that points beyond itself to its divine source, making the Gospel plausible to a skeptical world.

### **4.3 Accountability as High Respect: Expecting Greatness**

Holding oneself and others to a high standard is not an act of patronizing judgment but a profound expression of respect. The command to “Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed” establishes a rigorous personal standard of excellence. This standard is then extended to the community through mutual encouragement and the call to “build each other up”.  

This posture of high expectation is rooted in the theological conviction of the *imago Dei*—the belief that every human being is created in the image of God and therefore possesses immense potential. To expect greatness from others is to affirm this created dignity. It is a refusal to settle for mediocrity and a confident belief in the transformative power of God’s grace to elevate individuals and communities to their highest potential. This is the essence of respecting others enough to expect more from them, just as one expects more from oneself.

## **Section V: Synthesis and Refinement: A Restatement of the Vision**

The theological framework of humble potency presents an integrated model for Christian life and influence. It is a continuous cycle where each element reinforces the others, creating a powerful and attractive witness to the world.

### **5.1 Summary: The Integrated Model of Humble Potency**

The journey begins with the radical, honest acceptance of our insufficiency before a holy God. This posture of **Humility** is not a weakness but the strategic prerequisite that unlocks access to divine grace and power. This grace fuels a mandate to cultivate our God-given talents to their highest potential, pursuing sanctified **Competence** in every area of life as an act of worshipful stewardship. This acquired strength and skill finds its sole legitimate purpose in the selfless **Service** of others and the active pursuit of justice, [modeling the cruciform](https://cruciformlife.wordpress.com/2008/08/15/what-is-the-cruciform-life/) power of Christ. 

Finally, the consistent, lived reality of this integrated life becomes a compelling and attractive **Witness**, giving the glory to God in any public statements as a demonstration of the transformative goodness and power of God that gives credence to the Gospel message proclaimed by the disciples of Christ.

### **5.2 Table: Thematic Synthesis of Scriptural Principles for Humble Potency**

### **5.3 Refined Statements Summarizing The Thesis Of This Report**

* **It Starts With PERSONAL Discipleship:** It's NOT about *what somebody else needs to do.*" True discipleship begins in the humble confession of our inability to perfectly imitate Christ, but the resolute determination driven by LOVE to work on the discipline of discipleship. From this foundation of grace, we are called to cultivate Spirit-given competence, not for self-aggrandizement, but to serve others with discerning love and to defend the vulnerable, thereby becoming a living testament to the transformative power of the Gospel."  

* **Christian Leadership and Influence:** "The paradox of Christian leadership is that authentic power is forged in the crucible of humility. We are therefore called to be masters of our craft—strategic, discerning, and relentlessly competent—so that we may steward our influence not to be served, but to serve, to establish justice, and to model a standard of excellence that honors God and calls forth the best in others."  

* **National or Community Vision:** "A truly Christian nation must find ways to embrace the paradox of **humble potency**. We are defined not by a claim to inherent goodness, but by our constant reliance on divine grace. This humility frees us to become fiercely competent: hard-working, strategically wise, and strong in the service of justice. Our power is measured by our protection of the vulnerable, our love is guided by discerning wisdom, and our character is a compelling example of respecting others by expecting greatness, just as we, in humility, pursue it ourselves."
