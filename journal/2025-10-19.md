[How can we be better disciples of Christ?](https://gemini.google.com/share/5a41eebe1555) ... this is entirely about [IMITITATING Christ: Strength, Service, Humility](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1poYtcHpI8_hieB5yG5ESiaSNUvYb84ERcQ0idFBefLk/edit?usp=sharing).

How do we practically **develop the small disciplines with each waking moment that result in STRENGTH**, the discipline of walking, doing things, exercising to getting stronger, rather than sitting around moping or worrying or being entertained?  But actually, strength is sort of easy ... it's a lot tougher be of genuine **SERVICE** to others.

How do we practically **develop the small disciplines with each waking moment that result in the capacity to be of real service**, the discipline of listening, understanding, not doing things for people but helping them to be able to help themselves so that they are independent and don't need us to do things for them, RATHER THAN jumping in to help them with what we think they need, writing checks, swooping in with chainsaws and heavy equipment to clean up disasters? What is it about our egomaniacal human nature that makes us want to be the white knight, the hero, the savior, the one with all the answers, rather than being humble servants who LISTEN, seek first to UNDERSTAND, to help others deal with their issues and help themselves? Don't we know that the guy with the all of the answers is always the one who is creating more problems than he is solving?

How do we practically **develop the small disciplines with each waking moment that result in HUMILITY**, RATHER THAN acting as if we are some omniscient God, can we actually recognize our own limitations, weaknesses, and our own NEED for growth and change -- why is it so necessary for humans to be so prideful, arrogant, needing to have all of the answers, all the solutions, to be the judge of good and evil?

The POINT of personal knowledge management and engineering, (PKM/PKE) is to help me to develop the advanced levels of disciplines of STRENGTH, SERVICE, and HUMILITY in my daily life. 

The whole point of KNOWLEDGE is not about having answers or the abiliy to rapidly fix something -- the point of knowledge to be able to APPRECIATE the blessing of the Creator and to ask better, deeper, more insightful questions ... because, active listening or LISTENING better is not about having answers, but rather is about THINKING first, to genuinely UNDERSTAND better ... if I genuine want to be SERVICE to others, I need to **be humble to the point of being anonymous.** 

Jesus Christ has already been Jesus ... when I seek to imitate him, I don't need to *replicate* him ... I do not need to rush in like some fool to be the superhero in a cape; it's not up to me to be the savior or healer or celebrity who people seek out to cure their self-induced leprosy and constant deprivation from living in the materialist filth of the world and consuming the prograndized need for more and more and more stuff ... with better knowledge, I can ANONYMOUSLY step in to stop situations from escalating or ideally shrinking the target-rich environment to eliminate the opportunity for situations to arise ... rather than being a know-it-all or miraculous billionaire who creates more problems by advocating a vehicle or an appliance or spaceship to escape junked up existences on Earth or invents some other costly piece of junk technology that people don't need, can't afford, and that ultimately just distracts them from the real work of self-improvement and becoming what their Creator intended them to be.
