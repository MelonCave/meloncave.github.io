[Information is about more than compute](https://share.google/aimode/01NpK1wW20nbIscWz), but when we think about [new building blocks of information technology](http://extropic.ai/writing/tsu-101-an-entirely-new-type-of-computing-hardware), we should also start with the assumption that information is thermal, spectral using probablistic quantum states rather than mechanical tabulation and processing or stepping thru structured algorithms ... in other words, **knowledge exploration** should make our methods, technologies, management, collaboration and entire knowledge environment smarter ... it should not encourage brain rot. 

To help aid that thinking, it might be better if our leisurely random knowledge explorations were not just brainrot of scrolling through things that somebody else's recommendation engine has suggested, but perhaps something like [WikiTok.io app](https://www.wikitok.io/) which is a web app that provides a TikTok-inspired vertical scrolling interface for browsing random Wikipedia articles. Users can swipe through previews of articles (including titles, excerpts, and images), share links, and switch between multiple languages via country flags. It's designed to be responsive for mobile and desktop, with Progressive Web App (PWA) support for installation as a standalone app. The app operates without a backend, relying on client-side fetching to pull content dynamically, which keeps it lightweight and serverless-friendly.

Instead of RANDOM Wikipedia articles ... we might want a navigable map to EXPLORE our PKM knowledge content ... which is basically scraped or harvested from the pre-print archives ... and instead of a strictly random approach, we might want to look at related articles, with something like a ConnectedPapers knowledge graph as the navigable menu. 

### First, Examine How WikiTikTok Was Coded
Based on [DeepWiki analysis of public source code](https://deepwiki.com/IsaacGemal/wikitok), WikiTikTok (also referred to as WikiTok in the repo) is built as a single-page application (SPA) focused on frontend development. Here's a breakdown:

- **Tech Stack and Frameworks**: 
  - **React 18**: Used as the core JavaScript library for building the user interface. Components handle the scrolling feed, article previews, and interactive elements like language selection and sharing.
  - **TypeScript**: Provides type safety for the codebase, making it more maintainable for handling data structures like article objects (e.g., title, excerpt, image URL).
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Handles styling for the responsive, mobile-first design, including the vertical scroll layout that mimics TikTok's infinite feed.
  - **Vite**: Serves as the build tool and development server, enabling fast hot module replacement (HMR) during development and efficient bundling for production.

- **Code Structure and Key Implementation**:
  - The repository has a `/frontend` directory where the main development happens. This suggests the app is purely client-side.
  - Core functionality likely revolves around React components:
    - A main feed component that renders a list of article cards in a vertical, swipeable format (possibly using libraries like React Virtualized or custom CSS for infinite scrolling).
    - State management (via React's useState/useEffect or a library like Zustand/Redux) to handle fetching and preloading articles, managing language selection, and tracking scroll position.
    - Event handlers for user interactions, such as clicking to expand an article or sharing via Web Share API.
  - **Data Fetching**: While not explicitly detailed in the README, the app almost certainly integrates with the Wikipedia API (e.g., via endpoints like `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=random&rnnamespace=0&rnlimit=10&format=json` for random articles). This allows pulling random pages, summaries, and thumbnails on the fly. Language support swaps the API base URL (e.g., from `en.wikipedia.org` to `fr.wikipedia.org`).
  - **Performance Optimizations**: Preloading of upcoming articles ensures smooth scrolling. No server-side rendering (SSR) is mentioned, but Vite's setup supports fast builds.
  - **Deployment**: The app is hosted on Vercel, which handles serverless deployment seamlessly for React/Vite apps. Deployment would involve pushing to GitHub and linking to Vercel for automatic builds and previews.

The coding approach emphasizes simplicity: no complex backend, databases, or authentication. It's focused on API consumption and UI/UX to create an addictive browsing experience. Development commands (e.g., `bun dev` for local server, `bun build` for production) use Bun as the package manager for speed.

### Repositories and Resources for Building Something Similar
The exact source code for WikiTikTok is available on GitHub, making it easy to fork and modify. For similar projects, there are numerous open-source TikTok clones and tutorials that use comparable tech stacks (e.g., React/Next.js with Vercel deployment). These often include features like infinite scrolling, video/media handling (which could be adapted for Wikipedia content), and API integrations. Note that WikiTikTok doesn't appear to use any LLMs or AI models—it's API-driven—so no Hugging Face resources are directly relevant here. However, if you wanted to add AI features (e.g., summarizing articles with a model), you could integrate something like Hugging Face's Transformers library.

- **Exact WikiTikTok Repo**:
  - https://github.com/IsaacGemal/wikitok: The official repo for the app. Fork this to start building a variant. It includes the full frontend code, and you can deploy it to Vercel yourself.

- **Similar TikTok Clone Repos on GitHub (Adaptable for Wikipedia Integration)**:
  - https://github.com/John-Weeks-Dev/tiktok-clone-nextjs: A full-stack TikTok clone using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and AppWrite (for backend). Deployed on Vercel. You could replace video uploads with Wikipedia API fetches for a similar feed.
  - https://github.com/SashenJayathilaka/TIK-TOK-Clone: Another Next.js-based TikTok clone with Tailwind. Includes deployment docs for Vercel. Easy to modify for article-based content instead of videos.
  - https://github.com/danielmoisa/tiktok-app: A basic TikTok web clone with Next.js and PocketBase as the API backend. Vercel-compatible.
  - https://github.com/s-shemmee/TikTok-UI-Clone: Focuses on replicating TikTok's UI with React and CSS. No backend, similar to WikiTikTok's approach.
  - Other clones like https://github.com/BelkacemYerfa/tiktok or https://github.com/TariqKichawele/TokTik provide starting points for video-focused feeds that could be repurposed.

- **LLM Models on Hugging Face (If Adding AI Features)**:
  - No direct models for WikiTikTok, but if you want to enhance a similar app with AI (e.g., auto-generating summaries or recommendations), check Hugging Face's sentence-transformers for semantic search on Wikipedia content (e.g., https://huggingface.co/ai-maker-space/snowflake-ft-tiktok for embedding-based similarity, though it's TikTok-trained). General Wikipedia-related models are available at https://huggingface.co/models?other=wikipedia.

- **Tutorials and Blogs for Building on Vercel**:
  - Comprehensive guide to building a TikTok clone: Covers planning, features, and prebuilt solutions using modern stacks like React/Next.js.
  - YouTube tutorial on a full-stack TikTok clone with Next.js, TypeScript, and Vercel deployment.
  - Vercel's own blog on building AI-generated apps (if adding LLM features) with their platform API.
  - General Vercel starter kits for real-time apps, which could inspire interactive feeds.
  - Dev blogs like this one on rebuilding a Vercel-like platform or Hugo-based blogs on Vercel provide insights into deployment best practices. No specific Vercel blog post on WikiTikTok-like apps was found, but their main blog (https://vercel.com/blog) often covers Next.js and frontend deployments.

To build our own version, we start by [forking the WikiTok repo](https://github.com/IsaacGemal/wikitok) behind the [WikiTok.io app](https://www.wikitok.io/) to something we call [TikTokChili](https://github.com/MarkBruns/TikTokChili), we will integrate the Wikipedia API or other APIs as needed ... maybe eventually deploy via Vercel. The various [TikTok clone tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zLyVzItZlQ) provide step-by-step code walkthroughs for the full stack dev behind the TikTok clones like WikiTok.
