## Primary mdBook functionality built on AlphaXiv direction

Continuing on from [the general strategy for AI-Assisted static site research discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OCd6s1NeKGp2NaZ-u52XGfkaO-0ue5YSRAPheXVfKi4/edit?usp=sharing) of on [utilizing existing resources in the emerging ecosystem for discussion of preprints](https://g.co/gemini/share/31562f83c0fd) ... today per our larger [project outline](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/projects), we *are* thinking about GitHub, mostly to exploit GitHub features -- not necessarily automation or GH Actions, but using GH Projects, Issues, Discussions.

The [primary functionality of our mdBook will built on the foundation of AlphaXiv](https://www.alphaxiv.org/blog/one-year); it's important to attempt to stay current with what entities such as [AlphaXiv](https://www.alphaxiv.org/), [arXivLabs](https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html), [AI2](https://allenai.org/) [Asta](https://asta.allen.ai/discover), [Cohere Platform](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/the-cohere-platform), [Together AI](https://support.together.ai/), [Akash decentralized cloud](https://akash.network/docs/architecture/overview/), [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/), [DecodingBio content and discussion](https://www.decodingbio.com/reports) and similar others might offer.
