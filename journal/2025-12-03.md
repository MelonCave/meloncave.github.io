# 100 ways to SIMPLIFY, yet improve my life

In terms of AN EXAMPLE of ways to improve and SIMPLIFY, I might point to the various tech upgrades that I could contemplate for nature audio and podcastering. MOSTLY, I ***want*** life to be SIMPLER ... *I do not want MORE toys and stuff. I want SIMPLE, but I want BETTER.*

I really, really **want** my life to be simpler, cleaner ... except my life is already pretty simple and pretty danged awesome, even I could do a better job of housekeeping and polishing -- mostly, I am extremely very grateful for what I have, that I don't have more and I am struck by the realization that if anything, I need to do a better job of enjoying and using what I have and sometimes that means eliminating what still works and replacing it with something that is simpler, easier to lug around, easier to keep orderly and clean ... understand, I do not NEED my life to be simpler; the level of simple I *want* is a luxury. So I am blessed to have a life is full of options. *I am especially grateful for an awesome MINIMALIST life with lots of even better options be more minimal without sacrificing performance.*

When it comes to the example of recording nature audio or maybe audio for podcasts, continuing to use my [Zoom H6](https://zoomcorp.com/en/us/handheld-recorders/handheld-recorders/h6-audio-recorder/) is one option that is not bad at all. If I were looking for a way to be critical or looking for ways to find fault, I might argue that my H6 is a bit clunky ... the same would be of course be true of using all kinds of professional quality audio equipment, microphones, DAWs and all kinds of audio ***BAGGAGE*** that I detest. So for now, using the H6 might indeed be the best option until I am certain which direction to take. MOSTLY, I want life to be simpler, ie I want fewer microphones, cables, stands/tripods and various sorts of gear to lug around. I want life to be simpler, ie less cluttered with gadgets, cables or gear ... a smartphone that gave me most of what the H6 gives me might be ideal BECAUSE THAT APPROACH WOULD BE SIMPLER, and NOT because the technical audio quality specs are better. 

The result of my recordings is my podcast which is mainly for my own consumption/personal reflection and for people who are like me, but I still want the audio to be of relatively high quality for the different me that I will be when I listen in 3 months or 3 years from now. In order to achieve audio quality that is on par or above that of the Zoom H6 audio recorder, I asked SuperGrok to quick-curate a list of 100 different strategies or device or combination of devices for achieving this level of sound quality.
