## Use or Abuse Of Information Technologies

What you get out of information technologies depends on what you put into them.  Garbage in, garbage out ... if you spend time developing appropriate prompts and context engineering, AI provides some extremely powerful and useful responses ... if you *just google it* like a any old senile lazy fuck, the response will be better than you deserve, but it will be junk BECAUSE OF YOU AND YOUR LACK OF PREPARATION pre-disposed the exercise to be a failure, because YOU were lazy and FAILED at the outset.

Of course, there are several mountains of stuff to think about ... because of attempting to automate the [the best practices of serious PKM systems](https://ancientguy.github.io/PKM/2.Areas/00PKMSystems.html) ... but, first of all, understanding what we are looking for and how we are going to look for it will takes us into the realm of deeply thinking about how one uses or abuses information technologies in efforts to help us think about how we think and express ideas to one another. Because at its core, information technology is about us, ie IT can't fix stupid, that's up to us.
