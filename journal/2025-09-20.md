## Cline, Devin, Codex, Other Agentic Tools ... like [Zen](https://docs.zen-browser.app/) or [Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com/)

***WAIT!  What?!! How did I end up getting side-tracked from the mission of looking at AI-assisted IDEs and coding agents into delving into the NEW browser wars?*** ... it's longish story and I dunno if I really have to explain why I started off looking into the tool industry niche of Cline, Devin, Codex, Jules et al and ended up deciding that I [probably need to be ***using*** Arc or Zen](https://docs.zen-browser.app/faq#why-cant-zen-browser-play-drm-protected-content) ... partly because of [Zen's open sourcedness and Firefox's history of design focus on safety](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop) ... but MOSTLY it's ORDINARY stuff, eg like how Zen browser gets more serious about boosting productivity by offering robust tools for organization, multitasking, and focus within a highly customizable interface. The Zen feature set is largely inspired by the productivity-focused [Arc browser] ... or the AI-assisted version of Arc, "*personal assistant that’s already up to speed*", [the Dia browser](https://www.diabrowser.com/), but Zen is built on the Mozilla Firefox engine rather than Arc's reliance on Chromium.

***Why haven't web browsers been totally re-designed to foster/accelerate human-in-the-loop AI-collaborative communities of machine and human inference learning agent teams?***

Consider the [recent META Superintelligence "Compute as Teacher" paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14234), which explores how AI systems can turn their own inference processes into self-supervision without needing external ground truth. It hints at a world where machines learn more autonomously, but what about fostering human-in-the-loop collaboration through crowds of people discussing the finer point of an issue using their web browsers.  Why haven't we seen browsers evolve into platforms for seamless teams of human and AI agents, where inference and learning happen or evolve collectively?

Part of the reason lies in the historical inertia of browser design. Web browsers originated as tools for rendering static content and enabling basic interactivity, built around standards like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that prioritize compatibility and security over dynamic, collaborative AI integration. Redesigning them to support "communities of machine and human inference learning agent teams" would require fundamental paradigm shifts in terms of thinking about how smart internet user ARE, such as embedding real-time AI orchestration layers that handle shared state, privacy-preserving data flows, and adaptive interfaces for hybrid decision-making. 

This hasn't happened widely because browser vendors like Google, Mozilla, and Apple focus on **INCREMENTAL** *user-base-preserving* improvements—things like performance, privacy sandboxing, or extension ecosystems—rather than radical overhauls that could disrupt the web's backward compatibility, ie expect humans to be capable of being intelligent would WAKE PEOPLE UP!

For instance, helpful extensions like those for AI assistants already exist, but they're siloed add-ons, not core to the browser's architecture or capable of really making use of the processing power of the user, ie integrated, small-scale artificial intelligence for organizing user knowledge managment systems and giving users the power over thier own private human networks of colleagues, friends, family ... which means that browser are ARCHITECTURALLY limited in their ability to function as "Integrated Knowledge Engineering Environments" or IKEEs ... so users tend to log on to central hubs that they don't control ... such as like GitHub/LinkedIn [MSFT/OpenAI] or Facebook [META] or Twitter [Xai] or Anthropic [AWS] or Gemini [GOOG] ... RATHER THAN using intelligent IKEEs to curate their own LOCAL, persistent, collaborative "agent teams" across sessions or users, which are free from the interference by the CENTRALIZING information corps ... as with ATT or IBM in the old days, these corporations derive their economic sustenance from ensuring that humans are not in control of their friendships or relationships, but instead need Big Brother to keep humans civil.

On the AI side, of course superintelligence research like Meta's CaT method shows promise for reference-free learning in models ... but human-in-the-loop systems often struggle with scalability and trust issues and humans getting their feelings hurt ... Facebook can't REALLY afford to offer a serious, no-holds-barred discussion -- but MOSTLY, Facebook/META and the other centralizing information corps do not want humans to get along, ie there's too much $ in the business of being the intermediary ... *not so much because shots will be fired, ie the shots by deranged kooks are going to be fired anyway* ... Meta can allow people to share irrelevant, possibly heartwarming pix of friends and family from 5, 10, 25, 50 years ago, but it can't allow legit discussion, **because the TRUTH might break out!** 

Collaborative AI-human setups require robust mechanisms for feedback loops, error correction, and equitable contribution, but browsers are not optimized for this, ie it's not even on the designer's radar screens yet.  Users of browsers are handled as strictly passive viewers RATHER than active facilitators exhibiting any degree of agency. 

Emerging trends in human-AI interaction suggest we're moving toward it—think of projects exploring browser-based multi-agent systems or tools that integrate LLMs for real-time annotation and learning—but adoption is slow due to concerns over data privacy, computational overhead (running inference in-browser demands efficient edge computing), and the lack of standardized protocols for AI agent interoperability. If browsers were redesigned with something like CaT-inspired synthesis in mind, where human inputs reconcile AI rollouts, we might see more organic communities form, but right now, the ecosystem favors standalone apps or cloud services over browser-native collaboration.

To dig deeper into current discussions, we probably need to have a LOT more WELL-INFORMED discussions, passionate arguments and WARS, eg browser wars, on the whole topic human-AI collaboration or browser evolution to see if there's momentum building. It's NOT the technical barriers or potential applications that matter ... it's all about what humans WANT.  Do humans WANT be the kinds of morons that settle for the lame scummy experience that Facebook has become? Perhaps so ... one would hope that somebody has a better vision and that vision finds support.  

So, the SHORTER answer, explaining why the browser is more interesting than the Cline, Devin, Codex circus is that just focusing on a simple, commonplace, ordinary everyday tool like a web brower is about PRODUCTIVITY ... but only because I tend to LEAN ON a browser more than I *use* an IDE or coding assistant ... that'd be different if I leaned more heavily on VS Code or JetBrains IDE or GitButler or ... the point here is that most ordinary people are just not going to use IDEs -- they are not DEVS ... people SHOULD be using Integrated Knowledge Engineering Environments (IKEEs) because humans should be doing knowledge engineering, because knowledge engineering is fundamentally about relationships with others who are sources of HUMAN points-of-view, thus HUMAN knowledge ... ARTIFICIAL intelligence is unlike HUMAN intelligence because HUMANS have a unique soul, thus a unique point of view ... so calling a web-browser an IKEE might be too tech-sounding -- YES, of course, doing this is about USING tech in order to build, curate, improve HUMAN relationships with KNOWLEDGABLE humans

***Frankly, there's not any real reason in expanding or enhancing relationships with humans who have given up and decided against being knowledgeable about anything.***

### SPECIFICALLY, what are the Zen browser features that enhance productivity?

#### Better tab and workspace management, architecturally -- not as an afterthought

**Workspaces:** You can create dedicated workspaces to organize tabs for different projects, tasks, or aspects of your life, such as "Work," "Personal," or "Learning." This prevents a cluttered tab bar and allows you to switch between focused areas with a single click.

**Vertical tabs:** The browser defaults to a vertical tab list in a side panel, which can be more intuitive for managing numerous open tabs than a horizontal bar. The sidebar can also be auto-hidden in "Compact Mode" to maximize screen space.

**Container tabs:** Inherited from Firefox, this feature allows you to separate cookie sessions into different "containers" within the same browser profile. This lets you log into multiple accounts on the same site at once (e.g., a work email and a personal email) without any data bleeding between them.

**Essential and pinned tabs:** Tabs can be marked as "Essential" to be always-on and reload on startup, or "Pinned" to anchor them to the top of your tab list. These options help you keep your most important sites easily accessible. 

#### Multitasking and distraction reduction

Split View: This feature lets you view multiple websites side-by-side within a single window, making it easy to compare information or work between two pages. You can arrange up to four tabs in a split-screen view.

Zen Glance: To avoid getting sidetracked, you can "glance" at a link by holding a modifier key (like Alt) while clicking. This opens a link in a temporary, smaller preview window, allowing you to dismiss it easily if it's not what you need.

Compact Mode: This option hides unnecessary browser UI elements like the tab bar and address bar to reduce distractions and provide a cleaner, more focused browsing view. The hidden elements can be quickly accessed by moving your mouse to the edge of the screen. 

#### Customization and other features

Zen Mods: Through a dedicated "mods" store, users can install community-made themes and plugins to further customize the browser's appearance and functionality. This allows you to personalize the interface to your specific workflow.

Firefox compatibility: Because Zen is built on Firefox, it is compatible with the large library of Firefox add-ons. This gives you access to a wide variety of tools, including ad-blockers like uBlock Origin, to tailor your browsing environment for enhanced privacy and focus.

Command Bar: Similar to Arc, Zen has a command bar that lets you execute browser actions, switch between workspaces, and search more efficiently.

#### Using Cline as a browser extension

Cline's new CLI and core gRPC service, announced on September 19, 2025, is not yet publicly released as of September 20, 2025 which creates a primary barrier to implementation in any form, including browser extensions ... but this will likely soon be rectified ... any technical barriers that exist for integrating Cline into browser extensions would likely be due to the need for browser-compatible communication with the local gRPC service, though solutions like gRPC-Web or native messaging could mitigate this with additional development effort. Evidence leans toward similar challenges for both Chromium-based (e.g., Chrome) and Firefox-based browsers, including permissions, setup complexity, and cross-platform compatibility, but **no insurmountable restrictions from browser policies.**

The September 19, 2025, announcement by Cline's Head of AI details a rearchitecture into a standalone "cline core" gRPC service, decoupling the agentic loop from editors like VS Code. This enables new integrations, including a JetBrains plugin (released in general availability that week), a Go-based CLI (slated for imminent release without a terminal user interface to prioritize scriptability), and undisclosed projects. The CLI is positioned as a "true primitive" for integration into reinforcement learning environments, CI/CD pipelines, and automation, using SQLite for instance management to handle parallel operations without conflicts. This architecture theoretically allows connections from diverse interfaces, including mobile apps and web dashboards, but specifics on browser support remain unclear.

As of September 20, 2025, the CLI and core service appear unreleased, with no dedicated GitHub repository identified beyond the main TypeScript-based extension repo. This availability gap poses the most immediate barrier to browser extension development, as testing and integration require access to the core. Once available, technical hurdles emerge from gRPC's browser incompatibility; native gRPC isn't feasible without adaptations like gRPC-Web, which wraps calls in HTTP/1.1-compatible formats but demands server-side enablement or proxies. Go's gRPC implementation can support this via libraries, but if not pre-configured in cline core, developers must extend it.

Native messaging offers a viable workaround, supported in both Chromium and Firefox, allowing extensions to pipe data to a local Go host that interfaces with the core. This involves creating a manifest-declared host, installing it via OS-specific methods (e.g., registry keys on Windows, JSON manifests on macOS/Linux), and handling JSON-serialized messages. However, this increases user friction: extensions require "nativeMessaging" permissions, and users must manually install the host, potentially deterring adoption. Security implications include risks from local service exposure, though mitigated by user-granted permissions.

Browser differences add nuance. Chromium's Manifest V3 emphasizes service workers and promises for efficiency but limits persistent background pages, potentially affecting real-time gRPC polling. Firefox's WebExtensions align closely but enforce stricter privacy reviews, especially for extensions accessing local resources. Both stores (Chrome Web Store, Mozilla Add-ons) scrutinize such features, with possible rejection if not justified. Sideloading bypasses this for personal use, but distribution remains challenging.

Performance considerations include gRPC's overhead for large codebase contexts, which could strain browser resources compared to IDE integrations. Use cases for a Cline extension might involve web-based coding aids, like assisting in browser dev tools or integrating with platforms like GitHub Codespaces, but Cline's strengths in terminal and editor execution may not translate seamlessly. Community feedback highlights enthusiasm for the Go CLI's potential in non-IDE scenarios, but no existing browser extensions were found.

In summary, while the architecture opens doors to innovative interfaces, barriers like release timing, protocol adaptations, and setup complexity make browser extension integration non-trivial but feasible for motivated developers. Future updates, such as SDK releases post-CLI, could ease this.
