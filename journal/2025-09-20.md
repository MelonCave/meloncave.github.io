## Cline, Devin, Codex, Other Agentic Tools ... like Zen or Dia

***WAIT!  What?!! How did I end up getting side-tracked from the mission of looking at AI-assisted IDEs and coding agents into delving into the NEW browser wars?*** ... it's longish story and I dunno if I really have to explain why I started off looking into the tool industry niche of Cline, Devin, Codex, Jules et al and ended up deciding that I [probably need to be ***using*** Arc or Zen](https://docs.zen-browser.app/faq#why-cant-zen-browser-play-drm-protected-content) ... partly because of [Zen's open sourcedness and Firefox's history of design focus on safety](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop) ... but MOSTLY it's ORDINARY stuff, eg like how Zen browser gets more serious about boosting productivity by offering robust tools for organization, multitasking, and focus within a highly customizable interface. The Zen feature set is largely inspired by the productivity-focused [Arc browser] ... or the AI-assisted version of Arc, "*personal assistant that’s already up to speed*", [the Dia browser](https://www.diabrowser.com/), but Zen is built on the Mozilla Firefox engine rather than Arc's reliance on Chromium.

***Why haven't web browsers been totally re-designed to foster/accelerate human-in-the-loop AI-collaborative communities of machine and human inference learning agent teams?***

Consider the [recent META Superintelligence "Compute as Teacher" paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14234), which explores how AI systems can turn their own inference processes into self-supervision without needing external ground truth. It hints at a world where machines learn more autonomously, but what about fostering human-in-the-loop collaboration through crowds of people discussing the finer point of an issue using their web browsers.  Why haven't we seen browsers evolve into platforms for seamless teams of human and AI agents, where inference and learning happen or evolve collectively?

Part of the reason lies in the historical inertia of browser design. Web browsers originated as tools for rendering static content and enabling basic interactivity, built around standards like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that prioritize compatibility and security over dynamic, collaborative AI integration. Redesigning them to support "communities of machine and human inference learning agent teams" would require fundamental paradigm shifts in terms of thinking about how smart internet user ARE, such as embedding real-time AI orchestration layers that handle shared state, privacy-preserving data flows, and adaptive interfaces for hybrid decision-making. 

This hasn't happened widely because browser vendors like Google, Mozilla, and Apple focus on **INCREMENTAL** *user-base-preserving* improvements—things like performance, privacy sandboxing, or extension ecosystems—rather than radical overhauls that could disrupt the web's backward compatibility, ie expect humans to be capable of being intelligent would WAKE PEOPLE UP!

For instance, helpful extensions like those for AI assistants already exist, but they're siloed add-ons, not core to the browser's architecture or capable of really making use of the processing power of the user, ie integrated, small-scale artificial intelligence for organizing user knowledge managment systems and giving users the power over thier own private human networks of colleagues, friends, family ... which means that browser are ARCHITECTURALLY limited in their ability to function as "Integrated Knowledge Engineering Environments" or IKEEs ... so users tend to log on to central hubs that they don't control ... such as like GitHub/LinkedIn [MSFT/OpenAI] or Facebook [META] or Twitter [Xai] or Anthropic [AWS] or Gemini [GOOG] ... RATHER THAN using intelligent IKEEs to curate their own LOCAL, persistent, collaborative "agent teams" across sessions or users, which are free from the interference by the CENTRALIZING information corps ... as with ATT or IBM in the old days, these corporations derive their economic sustenance from ensuring that humans are not in control of their friendships or relationships, but instead need Big Brother to keep humans civil.

On the AI side, of course superintelligence research like Meta's CaT method shows promise for reference-free learning in models ... but human-in-the-loop systems often struggle with scalability and trust issues and humans getting their feelings hurt ... Facebook can't REALLY afford to offer a serious, no-holds-barred discussion -- but MOSTLY, Facebook/META and the other centralizing information corps do not want humans to get along, ie there's too much $ in the business of being the intermediary ... *not so much because shots will be fired, ie the shots by deranged kooks are going to be fired anyway* ... Meta can allow people to share irrelevant, possibly heartwarming pix of friends and family from 5, 10, 25, 50 years ago, but it can't allow legit discussion, **because the TRUTH might break out!** 

Collaborative AI-human setups require robust mechanisms for feedback loops, error correction, and equitable contribution, but browsers are not optimized for this, ie it's not even on the designer's radar screens yet.  Users of browsers are handled as strictly passive viewers RATHER than active facilitators exhibiting any degree of agency. 

Emerging trends in human-AI interaction suggest we're moving toward it—think of projects exploring browser-based multi-agent systems or tools that integrate LLMs for real-time annotation and learning—but adoption is slow due to concerns over data privacy, computational overhead (running inference in-browser demands efficient edge computing), and the lack of standardized protocols for AI agent interoperability. If browsers were redesigned with something like CaT-inspired synthesis in mind, where human inputs reconcile AI rollouts, we might see more organic communities form, but right now, the ecosystem favors standalone apps or cloud services over browser-native collaboration.

To dig deeper into current discussions, we probably need to have a LOT more WELL-INFORMED discussions, passionate arguments and WARS, eg browser wars, on the whole topic human-AI collaboration or browser evolution to see if there's momentum building. It's NOT the technical barriers or potential applications that matter ... it's all about what humans WANT.  Do humans WANT be the kinds of morons that settle for the lame scummy experience that Facebook has become? Perhaps so ... one would hope that somebody has a better vision and that vision finds support.  

So, the SHORTER answer, explaining why the browser is more interesting than the Cline, Devin, Codex circus is that just focusing on a simple, commonplace, ordinary everyday tool like a web brower is about PRODUCTIVITY ... but only because I tend to LEAN ON a browser more than I *use* an IDE or coding assistant ... that'd be different if I leaned more heavily on VS Code or JetBrains IDE or GitButler or ... the point here is that most ordinary people are just not going to use IDEs -- they are not DEVS ... people SHOULD be using Integrated Knowledge Engineering Environments (IKEEs) because humans should be doing knowledge engineering, because knowledge engineering is fundamentally about relationships with others who are sources of HUMAN points-of-view, thus HUMAN knowledge ... ARTIFICIAL intelligence is unlike HUMAN intelligence because HUMANS have a unique soul, thus a unique point of view ... so calling a web-browser an IKEE might be too tech-sounding -- YES, of course, doing this is about USING tech in order to build, curate, improve HUMAN relationships with KNOWLEDGABLE humans

***Frankly, there's not any real reason in expanding or enhancing relationships with humans who have given up and decided against being knowledgeable about anything.***

### SPECIFICALLY, what are the Zen browser features that enhance productivity?

#### Better tab and workspace management, architecturally -- not as an afterthought

**Workspaces:** You can create dedicated workspaces to organize tabs for different projects, tasks, or aspects of your life, such as "Work," "Personal," or "Learning." This prevents a cluttered tab bar and allows you to switch between focused areas with a single click.

**Vertical tabs:** The browser defaults to a vertical tab list in a side panel, which can be more intuitive for managing numerous open tabs than a horizontal bar. The sidebar can also be auto-hidden in "Compact Mode" to maximize screen space.

**Container tabs:** Inherited from Firefox, this feature allows you to separate cookie sessions into different "containers" within the same browser profile. This lets you log into multiple accounts on the same site at once (e.g., a work email and a personal email) without any data bleeding between them.

**Essential and pinned tabs:** Tabs can be marked as "Essential" to be always-on and reload on startup, or "Pinned" to anchor them to the top of your tab list. These options help you keep your most important sites easily accessible. 

#### Multitasking and distraction reduction

Split View: This feature lets you view multiple websites side-by-side within a single window, making it easy to compare information or work between two pages. You can arrange up to four tabs in a split-screen view.

Zen Glance: To avoid getting sidetracked, you can "glance" at a link by holding a modifier key (like Alt) while clicking. This opens a link in a temporary, smaller preview window, allowing you to dismiss it easily if it's not what you need.

Compact Mode: This option hides unnecessary browser UI elements like the tab bar and address bar to reduce distractions and provide a cleaner, more focused browsing view. The hidden elements can be quickly accessed by moving your mouse to the edge of the screen. 

#### Customization and other features

Zen Mods: Through a dedicated "mods" store, users can install community-made themes and plugins to further customize the browser's appearance and functionality. This allows you to personalize the interface to your specific workflow.

Firefox compatibility: Because Zen is built on Firefox, it is compatible with the large library of Firefox add-ons. This gives you access to a wide variety of tools, including ad-blockers like uBlock Origin, to tailor your browsing environment for enhanced privacy and focus.

Command Bar: Similar to Arc, Zen has a command bar that lets you execute browser actions, switch between workspaces, and search more efficiently.

The thing is ... four days WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED be spent practicing **fundamental** tasks with Cline and OpenRouter ... and getting ideas to try by [going over the documentation with fine-tooth comb](https://docs.cline.bot/getting-started/for-new-coders) ... including [Issues that people have had in the past](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/2305) or [are having now](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/) ... but Cline, the company is experience growth pains and cultural issues, thus a moving target organization-wise and mission-wise, ie it's no longer just a VS Code extension ...in the midst of revamping the tech an changing the mission, Cline is possibly disintegrating or about to be cut up or acquired and reconfigured target ... although Cline might be ok or better than ever -- but it's tough to figure out exactly what's going on ... just as other companies in this space, eg Devin is the new Windsurf ... it's NOT that Devin did not acquired, get acquired by, ate or get eaten by in order to be re-branded Windsurf; instead, Cognition AI, the creators of the Devin AI coding agent, acquired Windsurf in July 2025. This acquisition allows Cognition to integrate Devin's autonomous coding capabilities into Windsurf's agentic IDE, aiming to create a seamless environment where developers can plan, delegate to "a team of Devins," and review code within a single platform. The move came shortly after Google hired Windsurf's CEO and other key personnel, and following the expiration of a potential acquisition deal with OpenAI eating Windsurf ... so you might conclude that Google Jules is maybe even more likely to be Windsurf-like than Devin. 

We want to understand how people are effectively ***using*** their agentic assistants ... and USING means still getting things done, while the tool is under heavy development, like Cline is, not get too lost in the gaseous vaporware or discussions of what it WILL DO or where the tech might be going... it's about learning Cline's interaction patterns and places where the bigger snags happen right now ... Cline is sort of remarkably polished, but still far different than using something like [Git at v 2.52](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.52.0.adoc) ... yes, [Cline at v 3.29.1](https://github.com/cline/cline/releases/tag/v3.29.1) might seem somewhat mature to some -- it's still really new, not enough people have used it in different situations, so it's still a moving target ... it's important to NOT get too hung up on what it can't do however, but to focus on what is known to be an Issue, because bugs that give people pain have ways of becoming features. 

Simple, declarative prompts were used to test the mechanics of Cline on the user end ...  such as: "Create a new file named TODO.md and add three items," or "Read the README.md file and provide a one-paragraph summary."  This is all pretty straightforward stuff -- yes, there there are little distinctions to master, like the difference between Cline's two primary modes: "Plan" mode, which allows for read-only exploration and task decomposition, and "Act" mode, which executes the proposed changes. The "Auto-approve" settings were investigated [but not actually used] to understand something about how Cline balances between the rapid, fluid experience of "vibe coding" and the safety and control of manually approving each step. Cline's ability to interact with the integrated terminal was evalated  ...  to do things such as running commands like ***ls -R*** to recursively list the project's file structure, confirming its ability to observe and interact with its environment ... but I guess I don't entirely understand the need for this, since Terminal is right there ... well, if one's using VS Code, *but I don't know about the JetBrains IDE that Cline now works with ...*
