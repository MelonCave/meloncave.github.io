## Cline, Devin, Codex, Other Agentic Tools ... like Zen or Dia

***WAIT!  What?!! How did I end up getting side-tracked into delving into the NEW browser wars?*** ... it's longish story to explain why I started off looking into Cline, Devin et al and ended up deciding that I [probably need to be using Zen](https://docs.zen-browser.app/faq#why-cant-zen-browser-play-drm-protected-content) ... partly because of its [open sourcedness and design focus on safety](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop) ... but MOSTLY by how Zen browser gets more serious about boosting productivity by offering robust tools for organization, multitasking, and focus within a highly customizable interface. The Zen feature set is largely inspired by the productivity-focused [Arc browser] ... or the AI-assisted version of Arc, "*personal assistant that’s already up to speed*", [the Dia browser](https://www.diabrowser.com/), but is built on the Mozilla Firefox engine rather than Chromium.

The SHORT answer is that it's about PRODUCTIVITY ... because I LEAN ON a browser more than I *use* an IDE or coding assistant.

### What are the Zen features that enhance productivity?

#### Tab and workspace management

Workspaces: You can create dedicated workspaces to organize tabs for different projects, tasks, or aspects of your life, such as "Work," "Personal," or "Learning." This prevents a cluttered tab bar and allows you to switch between focused areas with a single click.

Vertical tabs: The browser defaults to a vertical tab list in a side panel, which can be more intuitive for managing numerous open tabs than a horizontal bar. The sidebar can also be auto-hidden in "Compact Mode" to maximize screen space.

Container tabs: Inherited from Firefox, this feature allows you to separate cookie sessions into different "containers" within the same browser profile. This lets you log into multiple accounts on the same site at once (e.g., a work email and a personal email) without any data bleeding between them.

Essential and pinned tabs: Tabs can be marked as "Essential" to be always-on and reload on startup, or "Pinned" to anchor them to the top of your tab list. These options help you keep your most important sites easily accessible. 

#### Multitasking and distraction reduction

Split View: This feature lets you view multiple websites side-by-side within a single window, making it easy to compare information or work between two pages. You can arrange up to four tabs in a split-screen view.

Zen Glance: To avoid getting sidetracked, you can "glance" at a link by holding a modifier key (like Alt) while clicking. This opens a link in a temporary, smaller preview window, allowing you to dismiss it easily if it's not what you need.

Compact Mode: This option hides unnecessary browser UI elements like the tab bar and address bar to reduce distractions and provide a cleaner, more focused browsing view. The hidden elements can be quickly accessed by moving your mouse to the edge of the screen. 

#### Customization and other features

Zen Mods: Through a dedicated "mods" store, users can install community-made themes and plugins to further customize the browser's appearance and functionality. This allows you to personalize the interface to your specific workflow.

Firefox compatibility: Because Zen is built on Firefox, it is compatible with the large library of Firefox add-ons. This gives you access to a wide variety of tools, including ad-blockers like uBlock Origin, to tailor your browsing environment for enhanced privacy and focus.

Command Bar: Similar to Arc, Zen has a command bar that lets you execute browser actions, switch between workspaces, and search more efficiently.

The thing is ... four days WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED be spent practicing **fundamental** tasks with Cline and OpenRouter ... and getting ideas to try by [going over the documentation with fine-tooth comb](https://docs.cline.bot/getting-started/for-new-coders) ... including [Issues that people have had in the past](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/2305) or [are having now](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/) ... but Cline, the company is experience growth pains and cultural issues, thus a moving target organization-wise and mission-wise, ie it's no longer just a VS Code extension ...in the midst of revamping the tech an changing the mission, Cline is possibly disintegrating or about to be cut up or acquired and reconfigured target ... although Cline might be ok or better than ever -- but it's tough to figure out exactly what's going on ... just as other companies in this space, eg Devin is the new Windsurf ... it's NOT that Devin did not acquired, get acquired by, ate or get eaten by in order to be re-branded Windsurf; instead, Cognition AI, the creators of the Devin AI coding agent, acquired Windsurf in July 2025. This acquisition allows Cognition to integrate Devin's autonomous coding capabilities into Windsurf's agentic IDE, aiming to create a seamless environment where developers can plan, delegate to "a team of Devins," and review code within a single platform. The move came shortly after Google hired Windsurf's CEO and other key personnel, and following the expiration of a potential acquisition deal with OpenAI eating Windsurf ... so you might conclude that Google Jules is maybe even more likely to be Windsurf-like than Devin. 

We want to understand how people are effectively ***using*** their agentic assistants ... and USING means still getting things done, while the tool is under heavy development, like Cline is, not get too lost in the gaseous vaporware or discussions of what it WILL DO or where the tech might be going... it's about learning Cline's interaction patterns and places where the bigger snags happen right now ... Cline is sort of remarkably polished, but still far different than using something like [Git at v 2.52](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.52.0.adoc) ... yes, [Cline at v 3.29.1](https://github.com/cline/cline/releases/tag/v3.29.1) might seem somewhat mature to some -- it's still really new, not enough people have used it in different situations, so it's still a moving target ... it's important to NOT get too hung up on what it can't do however, but to focus on what is known to be an Issue, because bugs that give people pain have ways of becoming features. 

Simple, declarative prompts were used to test the mechanics of Cline on the user end ...  such as: "Create a new file named TODO.md and add three items," or "Read the README.md file and provide a one-paragraph summary."  This is all pretty straightforward stuff -- yes, there there are little distinctions to master, like the difference between Cline's two primary modes: "Plan" mode, which allows for read-only exploration and task decomposition, and "Act" mode, which executes the proposed changes. The "Auto-approve" settings were investigated [but not actually used] to understand something about how Cline balances between the rapid, fluid experience of "vibe coding" and the safety and control of manually approving each step. Cline's ability to interact with the integrated terminal was evalated  ...  to do things such as running commands like ***ls -R*** to recursively list the project's file structure, confirming its ability to observe and interact with its environment ... but I guess I don't entirely understand the need for this, since Terminal is right there ... well, if one's using VS Code, *but I don't know about the JetBrains IDE that Cline now works with ...*
