2025 may have been a pivotally important year for the growth of the sport of Wrestling.  ONE reason for making that assertion involves Real American Freestyle (RAF), which is a new professional freestyle wrestling promotion launched in 2025, featuring real, unscripted matches with top NCAA, Olympic, and post-collegiate athletes. It aims to professionalize the sport by providing compensation opportunities (often via NIL partnerships for current collegians), entertainment production values, and a platform for sustained careers. Unlike WWE (scripted entertainment) or UFC (MMA with striking), RAF focuses purely on freestyle wrestling with modified rules for excitement. Compared to college football/basketball, it offers a post-college professional path for serious athletes but on a much smaller scale currently, with potential revenue from gates, streaming (Fox Nation), sponsorships (e.g., Real American Beer), and merchandise.

Here are **20 key points** to for us to consider about the BUSINESSS of Wrestling: 

1. **Founding and Ownership**: RAF was founded in 2025 by Chad Bronstein (CEO), Terri Francis, and the late Hulk Hogan, owned by Left Lane Capital with backing from venture funds. This business expertise aims to commercialize non-scripted wrestling matches that are not about just gawking at gratuitously violent fighting.

4. **Comparison to UFC**: RAF borrows UFC-style incentives for exciting moves (e.g., bonuses for dramatic takedowns) and personality promotion to build stars, but it's pure wrestling and a more cerebral form of athletic competition, rather than about striking, violence or hurting an opponent.
