We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-10-05.md) to build out Projects, completely RETHINKING P.A.R.A. structured PKE workflows ... to oversimplify what this PKM/PKE P.A.R.A. structured Project of Projects is about, the objective is to dev separate repos each with its own P.A.R.A. structure, for EVERY Area in our PKM Universe ... in a very vague and general sense, the knowledge result is about the kinds of things that we hope and expect might add significantly to our lives.

In continuing [[2015-10-07]] yesteday's examination of [robotics and AI skills development](https://ancientguy.github.io/PKM/2.Areas/18RoboticAIEducation.html), we continue by exploring side-hustles, the gig economy, startups and co-founders, awareness of the funding and acquhire issues as well as navigation of the project talent aquistion landscape.
