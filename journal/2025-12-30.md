# Year-end review Ancient Guy, Ancient Guy PKM, SoilQuality, MarkBruns, TDT GitHub Profile

1) **Doubling Down On Gratitude Journalling**

* The point of reflection on gratitude is about being more disciplined about conscientiousness because of blessings ... conscientiousness is entirely about courage and leadership.
* For example, saying grace before eating is like celebrating communion,about being more mindful about diet and how food will be put to use, how food will help me better imitate Jesus Christ
* [The Imitation of Christ](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/kempis/imitation.all.html) ... HE WHO follows Me, walks not in darkness per [John 8:12](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-12.html) which echoes [Exodus 3:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-14.html) in terms of how God has ordered Moses lead this transition from oppression to freedom per [Exodus 3:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/3/Exodus-3-10.html) ... so as we follow Christ, we are to be strong and courageous per [Joshua 1:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Joshua/1/Joshua-1-9.html) ... gratitude and adoration of Christ is the essence of conscientiousness, courage, and leadership

2) **Wealth For Humanity, Not Individual Egos**
   
* Wealth is fundamentally about abundance, and the abundance to be used to explore the Universe, to know more about ourselves and having enough to share the ENJOYMENT of knowledgew ... wealth should not be about oneupsmanship or individual egos accumulating stuff to show their superiority over other humans
* Currency should mainly beabout prioritization of resources -- we are able to enter an era of Information-Backed Currencies (IBC) using global consensus protocols that have evolve from random hashing to Combinatorial Optimization Consensus Protocols (COCP) with the transition defined by [different protocols or forms of Knowledge-Coin Economy where currency is a measure or receipt of a genuine achievement in computational advancement](https://gemini.google.com/share/7d62546127bc).
* The above collection of ideas can categorized by how they exhibit four critical pillars of this transition:
  * **Thermodynamic Utility**: Protocols transmuting energy into scientific discovery (Proof of Useful Work).
  * **Physical Infrastructure**: Decentralized networks coordinating hardware for compute, sensing, and connectivity (DePIN).
  * **Decentralized Knowledge**: Mechanisms for funding and verifying scientific intellectual property (DeSci).
  * **Verifiable Intelligence**: The intersection of cryptography and artificial intelligence (zkML and Agentic Markets).

3) **Greatly Simplified Time Mgmt**

This is largely about retirement and getting past the point where one stacks up little wastes of time, side-jobs, volunteer bullshit and actually starts getting SERIOUS about changing one's direction, exploring a NEW life ... and not treating retirement as simply an extended vacation or perhaps a job search and second JOB ... AVOID THE JOB TRAP!!!

* FOCUS ... stop building a massive to-do list or multi-tasking
* List five candidate BIG THINGS in the day BEFORE or even earlier
* Prioritize these things based on importance, not urgency -- but pick just ONE to get done for the day to be considered "one good day", AFTER the ONE big thing is done, move the next big thing that would make the rest of the day a great follow-on win ... repeat this to cycle through the list, but add the things that didn't get done to the next day's list   
* Use your "one good day" [and follow-on wins] to set the tone for tomorrow and the day after as you build momentum
* As you build momentum, make the BIG THINGS bigger ... and, by extension, the follow-on wins more impactful
* STOP EVER EVER EVER building a massive to-do list or multi-tasking, it's a trap ... and results in a lack of focus actually substituting LOT of little junk for things that matter

4) **PERSONAL Knowledge Engineering (PKE) is about PERSONAL programming**

* 2025 was largely about personal knowledge management, but 2026 has to start off being about personal knowledge engineering
* Moving beyond **computational assistance** where AI-assistance is glorified search to an era of **computational discovery** where AI is programmed, managed, pushed to help discover **new insights and new knowledge, ***particularly about ourselves***
* For me, PKE has to be about overcoming the bad habits of being ourselves ... this means more work on congnitve awareness, neuroscience, neurofeedback and neuroplasticity, and the science of learning and measured personal growth ... the POINT of AI has to be about my PERSONAL programming, coaching, training, and development
* Beyond books, methods, software, can continuously optimized PKE cognitive capabilities be improved with something like custom silicon or what kinds of brain-computer interfaces or neurotechnologies should we be considering?
