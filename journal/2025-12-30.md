# Year-end review Ancient Guy, Ancient Guy PKM, SoilQuality, MarkBruns, TDT GitHub Profile

1) **Doubling Down On Gratitude Journalling**

* The point of reflection on gratitude is about being more disciplined about conscientiousness because of blessings
* For example, saying grace before eating is like celebrating communion,about being more mindful about diet and how food will be put to use, how food will help me better imitate Jesus Christ

2) **Greatly Simplified Time Mgmt**

This is largely about retirement and getting past the point where one stacks up little wastes of time, side-jobs, volunteer bullshit and actually starts getting SERIOUS about changing one's direction, exploring a NEW life ... and not treating retirement as simply an extended vacation or perhaps a job search and second JOB ... AVOID THE JOB TRAP!!!

* FOCUS ... stop building a massive to-do list or multi-tasking
* List five candidate BIG THINGS in the day BEFORE or even earlier
* Prioritize these things based on importance, not urgency -- but pick just ONE to get done for the day to be considered "one good day", AFTER the ONE big thing is done, move the next big thing that would make the rest of the day a great follow-on win ... repeat this to cycle through the list, but add the things that didn't get done to the next day's list   
* Use your "one good day" [and follow-on wins] to set the tone for tomorrow and the day after as you build momentum
* As you build momentum, make the BIG THINGS bigger ... and, by extension, the follow-on wins more impactful
* STOP EVER EVER EVER building a massive to-do list or multi-tasking, it's a trap ... and results in a lack of focus actually substituting LOT of little junk for things that matter

3) **PERSONAL Knowledge Engineering (PKE) is about PERSONAL programming**

* 2025 was largely about personal knowledge management, but 2026 has to start off being about personal knowledge engineering
* Moving beyond **computational assistance** where AI-assistance is glorified search to an era of **computational discovery** where AI is programmed, managed, pushed to help discover **new insights and new knowledge, ***particularly about ourselves***
* For me, PKE has to be about overcoming the bad habits of being ourselves ... this means more work on congnitve awareness, neuroscience, neurofeedback and neuroplasticity, and the science of learning and measured personal growth ... the POINT of AI has to be about my PERSONAL programming, coaching, training, and development
