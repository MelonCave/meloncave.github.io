## YAGNI ... YOU AIN'T GONNA NEED IT!!!

Again today, per our [project outline](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/blob/main/journal/2025-09-23.md), we *are* thinking about automation and things like [GitHub Actions for GH Pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) especially those specifically [intended for mdBook and Rust](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-mdbook-rust) ... **HOWEVER** I am kind of gravitating toward just MANUALLY spending more time with the preprints directly and using [Asta to summarize research on a particular topic](https://asta.allen.ai/chat/0c3660da-373a-4939-810b-7d221c39b873)along with [PaperDigest Research Copilot](https://www.paperdigest.org/research/) and maybe the annual subscription if I need it ... I don't really need that many knowledge graphs at present, if that changes I will first use [ConnectedPapers BY THE MONTH](https://www.connectedpapers.com/pricing) and then maybe by the year.

Here's the thing ... with EITHER subscriptions or some brilliant idea to automate some manual fustercluck, the most likely things is YAGNI ... YOU AIN'T GONNA NEED IT!!!
