## AI-assisted deep research intelligence gathering

Again today, per our [project outline](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/blob/main/journal/2025-09-23.md), we *are* thinking about automation and things like [GitHub Actions for GH Pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) especially those specifically [intended for mdBook and Rust](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-mdbook-rust) ... **HOWEVER** I am kind of gravitating toward just MANUALLY spending more time with the preprints directly and using [Asta to summarize research on a particular topic](https://asta.allen.ai/chat/0c3660da-373a-4939-810b-7d221c39b873)along with [PaperDigest DeepResearch Copilot](https://www.paperdigest.org/research/) and maybe the annual subscription if I need it ... I don't really need that many knowledge graphs at present, if that changes I will first use [ConnectedPapers BY THE MONTH](https://www.connectedpapers.com/pricing) and then maybe by the year.

AI systems for research intelligence gathering operate through several fundamental capabilities that extend far beyond simple data retrieval, but here's the thing ... with EITHER subscriptions or some brilliant idea to automate some brilliant idea ... just [surveying abundance of new applicable, possibly better ideas being released daily](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/d1442338bd4b180fff78bb3403487b40d0223328) is a big enough task ... for almost all individual devs, the most likely things is that the time you waste automating some brilliant idea is for something NOBODY is ever going to use, including you -- that's because there are already better thngs that one can find with tools like Semantic Scholar, Asta, Research Coilot or Connected Papers out there ... so, unless you really know the current situation, your thing is *just an exercise* but YOU AIN'T GONNA NEED IT as much much as you NEED to just better understand the situational awareness of the environment. Most new shiny things are unnecessary ... but the MOST UNNECESSARY of all shiny new things is goint to be your pet project when you are not familiar with the other solutions already out there ... that's why PKM is fundamentally about [AI-assisted deep research intelligence gathering](https://asta.allen.ai/chat/75d984ec-9703-4cb8-ac1d-d90611be5045) applied to at least [100 key topic Areas](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/src/2.Areas).
