### EEG Protocols in Neuroarchitecture: Evidence-Based Details from Key Studies

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a cornerstone tool in neuroarchitecture, providing high temporal resolution to capture real-time brain responses to built environments. It measures electrical activity via scalp electrodes, revealing patterns like alpha waves (relaxation) or theta power (visual processing) in response to architectural features such as biophilic elements, curvatures, or material textures. Protocols typically involve controlled stimuli presentation (e.g., VR scenes or physical samples), artifact removal, and spectral analysis to link neural data to cognitive/emotional outcomes. Below, I detail protocols from four representative studies, drawing from recent experimental designs. These highlight stationary vs. mobile setups, common parameters, and findings tied to environmental renewal and cognitive health.

#### 1. Detection of EEG Activity in Response to Surrounding Environments (2025 Study)
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Objective** | Assess biophilic elements (e.g., forest views, indoor greenery) on visual processing and relaxation in minimalist rooms. |
| **Participants** | 22 healthy adults (mean age 28.7 years); seated in a controlled room with VR headsets. |
| **Setup & Hardware** | 19-channel wet-electrode EEG (eWave-24, 500 Hz sampling); 10-20 system placement; linked ear reference. |
| **Stimuli Presentation** | VR (Oculus Quest, 90 Hz): Alternating 10-s exposures to gray-scale room vs. biophilic variants (forest window or plant wall), with 5-s black screen breaks; total 7.4 min per session; passive viewing. |
| **Recording Parameters** | Band-pass filtered (1-48 Hz); ICA artifact rejection; segmented into 10-s trials; z-score normalized power in delta/theta/alpha/beta/gamma bands. |
| **Analysis Techniques** | Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (Bonferroni-corrected, p<0.05); topographical maps; regional averaging (occipital/parietal/etc.). |
| **Key Findings** | Biophilic environments suppressed alpha power (increased visual engagement) and boosted theta in occipital areas (relaxation), supporting neuroplasticity via reduced stress for cognitive renewal. No differences between view vs. wall greenery. |

#### 2. Mental Worlds Shaped by Neuroarchitecture: Effects of Indoor Materials (2025 Study)
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Objective** | Examine wood, concrete, and metal textures on brain activity, cognition (Stroop test), and emotions (POMS questionnaire). |
| **Participants** | 35 adults (mean age 28.6 years); seated in a minimalist lab with panels at eye level. |
| **Setup & Hardware** | 14-channel dry-electrode EEG (Emotiv Epoc); prefrontal/frontal/temporal/occipital sites. |
| **Stimuli Presentation** | Physical U-shaped desk panels for visual/tactile interaction; random-order 2-min exposures per material (natural/processed wood, concrete, metal); integrated with tasks; total ~8 min. |
| **Recording Parameters** | Eyes open, minimal movement; 1-min baseline (eye open/close); bands: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), gamma (30-45 Hz). |
| **Analysis Techniques** | ICA preprocessing; 3-s segmentation; power spectral density via ReliefF feature selection; SVM classification (93% accuracy); ANOVA/Wilcoxon for behavioral data (p<0.05). |
| **Key Findings** | Natural/processed wood enhanced gamma/beta (positive attention/emotions) and cognitive performance (94% Stroop accuracy), countering "hardening" via relaxation; concrete/metal increased cognitive load (low alpha) and stress, highlighting material choice for anti-decline environments. |

#### 3. Embodiment of Architectural Experience: Methodological Perspective (2022 Review with Examples)
This paper outlines stationary and mobile EEG protocols, emphasizing ecological validity for studying affordances (e.g., door widths) and emotional responses.

- **Stationary Protocols**: Participants view static 2D/VR images of facades/interiors on screens; seated/immobile for low-noise data. Example (Naghibi Rad et al., 2019): ERPs to window shapes (rectangular/circular/etc.); larger left-hemisphere effects for pleasant forms, indicating emotional hemispheric asymmetry. Example (Shemesh et al., 2021): EEG+GSR to virtual room proportions/curvatures; increased signals with extreme designs, showing distress in non-experts via frontal lobe activation.
  
- **Mobile Protocols (MoBI)**: Wireless EEG caps + VR/motion capture for free movement. Hardware: Active electrodes (e.g., 64-channel systems at 500-1000 Hz). Protocols: Active exploration tasks (e.g., walking VR paths); ERPs like PINV for affordance processing ~200 ms post-stimulus. Example (Banaei et al., 2017): Curved vs. angular VR spaces; curvature boosted anterior cingulate activity for adaptive thinking. Example (Djebbara et al., 2021): Door transitions (narrow/medium/wide) with Go/NoGo priming; PINV differences revealed automated motor planning, linking to rewiring for Parkinson's-like mobility.

- **Common Analysis**: ERP averaging; spectral power (alpha/theta for relaxation); synchronized with SAM questionnaires for subjective validation.

#### 4. Systematic Review of Experimental Methodologies in Neuroarchitecture (2022)
This review classifies EEG as a primary physiological measure (used in ~30% of studies), often paired with eye-tracking/VR for attention/emotion metrics. Common protocols: Lab-based (n=45 studies) with 20-64 channels (500-1024 Hz sampling); stimuli as 30-120 s video clips of real/VR spaces; passive/active tasks (e.g., rating aesthetics). Preprocessing: FIR/ICA filtering (0.5-50 Hz); analysis via ANOVA on band power or ERPs. Mobile EEG emerging (n=12 studies) for urban walks, but artifact-prone. Findings: EEG excels for temporal dynamics, e.g., alpha suppression in open vs. enclosed spaces, promoting designs for cognitive reserve against Alzheimer's.

These protocols demonstrate EEG's role in validating neuroarchitectural interventions, like biophilic designs for BDNF-boosting renewal. For implementation, start with affordable 14-channel systems like Emotiv for pilot studies. 


### fMRI in Neuroarchitecture: Evidence-Based Studies and Protocols

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a pivotal neuroimaging technique in neuroarchitecture, offering high spatial resolution to map brain activity in response to built environments. By measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, fMRI reveals how architectural elements—like curvature, lighting, or spatial layouts—influence neural networks involved in perception, emotion, navigation, and creativity. This supports designs that promote neuroplasticity, reduce stress (e.g., via amygdala modulation), and foster renewal over cognitive rigidity, aligning with strategies against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by enhancing hippocampal and default mode network (DMN) engagement. Unlike EEG's temporal focus, fMRI excels in pinpointing regional activations but requires stationary participants, limiting ecological validity.

Below, I detail protocols from four key studies, drawn from recent research. These emphasize experimental designs, stimuli, and implications for brain-healthy environments. Protocols typically involve block or event-related designs, with preprocessing (e.g., motion correction, smoothing) and analysis via SPM or FSL software for group-level contrasts.

#### 1. Neural Correlates of Curved vs. Angular Shapes in Healthcare Settings (Coburn et al., 2020; ANFA Study)
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Objective** | Investigate precognitive emotional responses to environmental contours in simulated hospital contexts, testing preferences for curved (biophilic) vs. angular designs. |
| **Participants** | 36 healthy adults (ages 18-65, balanced genders); screened for claustrophobia and MRI contraindications. |
| **Setup & Hardware** | 3T Siemens scanner; T2*-weighted EPI sequence (TR=2s, TE=30ms, 3x3x3mm voxels, 64x64 matrix); whole-brain coverage. |
| **Stimuli Presentation** | Event-related design: 300 trials of static images (objects, landscapes, healthcare rooms) with curved/angular contours; 2-4s duration per image, jittered ITI (1-3s); auditory hospital cues (e.g., beeps) for immersion; participants rated preferences via button press. Total session: ~15 min functional run + structural scan. |
| **Recording Parameters** | BOLD contrast; high-pass filter (128s); slice timing correction; realignment, normalization to MNI space. |
| **Analysis Techniques** | GLM with HRF convolution; FDR-corrected contrasts (p<0.05); ROI focus on amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); parametric modulation for preference ratings. |
| **Key Findings** | Curved shapes elicited higher amygdala activation in healthcare contexts (unexpected anxiety signal due to ambiguity), despite overall preferences; angular designs showed stronger visuospatial processing in occipital areas. Implications: Prioritize clear wayfinding in hospitals to mitigate stress, enhancing recovery and cognitive rewiring. |

#### 2. Perception of Architectural Landmarks and Scene Borders (Epstein et al., Various; Reviewed in 2024 PMC Article)
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Objective** | Examine parahippocampal place area (PPA) and occipital place area (OPA) responses to building interiors/exteriors and mid-level features like window frames. |
| **Participants** | Aggregated from multiple studies: 20-30 per experiment (young adults, right-handed); familiar/unfamiliar landmark exposure. |
| **Setup & Hardware** | 3T MRI scanners (e.g., Siemens Trio); EPI BOLD (TR=2-3s, 2.5-3mm isotropic voxels); multi-band acceleration for faster acquisition. |
| **Stimuli Presentation** | Block design: 16-24s blocks of photographs (campus buildings interiors/exteriors, scenes vs. objects); alternating with fixation crosses; some included ambiguous figures or VR navigation snippets. Sessions: 8-10 min runs, repeated for familiarity effects. |
| **Recording Parameters** | 180 volumes per run; physiological noise regression (cardiac/respiratory); motion scrubbing (<0.5mm). |
| **Analysis Techniques** | ROI-based (PPA/OPA defined via localizer scans); t-tests for scene > object contrasts; MVPA for decoding viewpoint specificity; cluster-thresholding (p<0.001, extent>10 voxels). |
| **Key Findings** | PPA/OPA activated robustly for architectural scenes, sensitive to borders and mid-level changes (e.g., frames boosting PPA by 20-30%); RSC engaged for landmark navigation. Implications: Designs with distinct landmarks enhance hippocampal mapping, supporting anti-decline environments via improved spatial memory. |

#### 3. Aesthetic Judgments of Interior Architecture (Vartanian et al., 2013/2015; Frontiers Review)
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Objective** | Assess brain responses to curvilinear vs. rectilinear interiors, ceiling height, and openness for beauty and approach-avoidance decisions. |
| **Participants** | 16-20 architecture novices/experts per study (ages 20-40); expertise as covariate. |
| **Setup & Hardware** | 3T GE scanner; gradient-echo EPI (TR=2s, TE=25ms, 3.4x3.4x3mm voxels); 25 axial slices. |
| **Stimuli Presentation** | Event-related: 400-500 trials of interior images (varied curvature, enclosure, height); 3s viewing + rating (beauty/approach on scale); fixation jitter (0.5-2s). Total: 12-15 min runs. |
| **Recording Parameters** | Volume acquisition every 2s; slice order: interleaved; fieldmap correction for distortions. |
| **Analysis Techniques** | SPM8 GLM; beauty parametric regressor; whole-brain FDR (p<0.05); ROIs in lingual gyrus, OFC, ACC; expertise interaction models. |
| **Key Findings** | Curvilinear/open designs activated visual cortex (lingual/calcarine gyri) and reward areas (OFC) more than angular/enclosed ones; higher ceilings boosted temporal lobe activity for enhanced beauty ratings. Implications: Curved, spacious layouts promote DMN relaxation and creativity, countering neural sclerosis in workspaces. |

#### 4. Organic Forms and Biophilic Elements in Sustainable Design (2025 Review)
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Objective** | Evaluate DMN and amygdala responses to organic vs. sharp-angled environments for stress and creativity metrics. |
| **Participants** | Meta-analysis of 15+ fMRI studies (n=300+ total, mixed ages); focused on biophilic vs. urban stark designs. |
| **Setup & Hardware** | Varied 3T systems; standard BOLD EPI (TR=2s, 3mm voxels); some with simultaneous EEG for multimodal validation. |
| **Stimuli Presentation** | Block design: 30s exposures to VR/static images of rooms with natural textures (e.g., wood/curves) vs. concrete/angles; passive viewing or contemplation tasks. Sessions: 10-20 min. |
| **Recording Parameters** | Nuisance regression (global signal, motion); smoothing (6mm FWHM). |
| **Analysis Techniques** | Network-based (DMN connectivity via seed-to-voxel); t-contrasts for stress (amygdala BOLD); effect sizes for cortisol proxies. |
| **Key Findings** | Organic forms activated DMN (posterior cingulate, precuneus) for 15-20% greater relaxation/creativity; sharp angles hyperactivated amygdala, raising cortisol. Implications: Biophilic integration in sustainable architecture boosts cognitive function (8-10%) and neuroplasticity, ideal for renewal-focused spaces like meditation areas. |

These fMRI protocols highlight neuroarchitecture's shift toward evidence-driven design, with emerging trends like VR-fMRI for dynamic exploration addressing stationary limitations. For instance, combining fMRI with daily practices (e.g., navigation tasks) could tailor environments for Parkinson's rewiring.
