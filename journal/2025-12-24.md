To help build a comprehensive understanding of what we can know about the body, we can explore diagnostic tools by categorizing them into functional groups. Using advanced diagnostics like **dMRI** (Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to monitor microstructural changes shifts the conversation from simply "working out" to "precision health management."
