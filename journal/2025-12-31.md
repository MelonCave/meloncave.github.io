# **Information-Backed Currencies, DePIN, and Decentralized Science**

## **Executive Summary**

Innovations endure when they solve real problems at scale—not through speculative hype or meme-driven attention capture. By 2025, major financial institutions have moved beyond blockchain pilots to adopt distributed ledgers as foundational infrastructure, driven by faster transactions, reduced settlement costs, and automated compliance.

Chase exemplifies this shift. Its Kinexys unit processes $2+ billion daily through JPM Coin for instant institutional transfers. December 2025 saw the launch of MONY, a tokenized money market fund on Ethereum, while the Liink network connects 400+ institutions for secure data exchange. Stripe has similarly embedded blockchain into global payments through Bridge (enabling stablecoin acceptance) and is building Tempo, a dedicated Layer-1 for high-volume transactions. Its "Open Issuance" platform supports business-launched stablecoins for loyalty-based, AI-driven smart commerce.Stripe users, especially those leveraging tools like Stripe Capital or building AI commerce companies, have shown significantly faster revenue growth than average businesses, with growth rates being 27% to over 100% faster depending on the business model. 

Innovation succeeds when it is better at solving real problems at scale -- that means practical, dramatic improvements in transaction speed, reduced settlement times/costs, and automation of tedious compliance tasks rather than the speculative "financial nihilism" of hype cycles, meme tokens, and attention-capture schemes. Looking ahead, we see the financial ecosystem evolving toward something like Information-Backed Currencies (IBCs). In general, this is about assets that derive value not from artificial scarcity or energy expenditure, but from verified knowledge production and indispensable utility, exemplified by the AI systems now integral to daily life.

By 2035, global consensus protocols will likely tend to evolve away from random hashing to Combinatorial Optimization Consensus Protocols (COCP) define the transition to something like a IBC or Knowledge-Coin Economy where currency is a receipt of computationally compounded advancement or knowledge asset. The annotated list below gives [100 examples of the kinds of protocols that may drive this shift](https://gemini.google.com/share/fdeae5d9089b). These protocols are categorized into four critical pillars:

1. **Thermodynamic Utility:** Protocols transmuting energy into scientific discovery (Proof of Useful Work).  
2. **Physical Infrastructure:** Decentralized networks coordinating hardware for compute, sensing, and connectivity (DePIN).  
3. **Decentralized Knowledge:** Mechanisms for funding and verifying scientific intellectual property (DeSci).  
4. **Verifiable Intelligence:** The intersection of cryptography and artificial intelligence (zkML and Agentic Markets).

**Section I: The Thermodynamics of Consensus (PoUW & COCP)**

The foundational critique of Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) has historically been its energy consumption—vast computational resources expended on finding SHA-256 nonces, a mathematical function with no utility beyond securing the ledger. **Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)** and **Combinatorial Optimization Consensus Protocols (COCP)** represent the response to this inefficiency.1 These protocols attempt to harness the security budget of a blockchain to solve NP-hard problems with real-world applications, such as protein folding, fluid dynamics, and machine learning training.3

The challenge for these protocols is the "Verification Dilemma": finding a problem that is difficult to solve (to prevent spam and Sybil attacks) but trivial to verify (so nodes can reach consensus quickly). The projects below have developed novel architectures to bridge this gap.

### **1\. Qubic (QUBIC)**

Description: Qubic utilizes a unique consensus mechanism termed Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) where "computors" (the network's miners) utilize their processing power to train artificial neural networks (ANNs). Built on a bare-metal code base rather than a traditional OS, Qubic aims to maximize hardware efficiency. The network aspires to create true artificial intelligence (AGI) by aggregating the cumulative training data of the network's mining activities. It employs a quorum-based voting system for instant finality and fee-less transactions.5  
Current Practicality: The network is operational, generating billions of neural network training iterations weekly. It maintains a high active node count, creating a robust decentralized compute layer. However, its practicality is currently largely internal; the AI results feed the network's own evolution rather than serving as a general-purpose commercial AI cloud.  
Development Needs: The primary hurdle is bridging the "air gap" between the protocol and the wider crypto-economy. This requires robust bridging to standard liquidity layers (CEX/DEX) and the development of developer tooling (SDKs) that allow third parties to easily extract and utilize the trained ANNs.

### **2\. Dynex (DNX)**

Description: Dynex positions itself as the world's first neuromorphic supercomputing blockchain. It utilizes a proprietary algorithm known as DynexSolve, which enables miners to perform "neuromorphic chip" simulations on standard consumer GPUs. This architecture is particularly adept at solving constraint satisfaction problems and optimization tasks—such as efficient logistics routing or molecular structuring—that are typically the domain of quantum computing.6  
Current Practicality: Dynex is actively marketed for scientific compute tasks, including drug discovery and architectural optimization. It has successfully created a functional marketplace where commercial entities can submit jobs to the network, differentiating it from purely theoretical PoUW chains.  
Development Needs: Scalability in job scheduling remains a bottleneck. As demand scales, the centralized components of the job dispatching mechanism must be further decentralized to prevent censorship and ensure trustless execution. Furthermore, the user interface for job submission requires simplification for non-academic users.

### **3\. Gridcoin (GRC)**

Description: A veteran in the space, Gridcoin rewards contributions to the BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) platform. While it uses Proof-of-Stake for chain security, the block rewards are distributed based on "ResearchMagnitude"—a metric derived from a user's verified contribution to approved scientific projects like Rosetta@home (protein folding) and Asteroids@home.7  
Current Practicality: Gridcoin is highly practical for scientific altruism, having supported academic research for over a decade. It successfully directs massive amounts of volunteer hash power toward disease research. However, its economic model relies heavily on the altruism of citizen scientists rather than market-driven demand for compute.  
Development Needs: The protocol requires modernization of its wallet infrastructure and deeper integration with DeFi ecosystems (such as wrapped versions on Ethereum/Solana) to provide better liquidity for rewards. Moving beyond BOINC to support Dockerized commercial workloads would significantly expand its total addressable market.

### **4\. CureCoin (CURE)**

Description: CureCoin incentivizes protein folding simulations specifically for the Folding@home project at Stanford University. It operates a hybrid system where traditional SHA-256 mining secures the blockchain (providing immutability), while a certificate server issues rewards based on folding contributions. This effectively merges the security of crypto-mining with the utility of biomedical research.7  
Current Practicality: The project successfully channels significant computational resources toward Alzheimer's, Cancer, and Huntington's disease research. It is a stable, functional network but lacks the programmable smart contract layers found in modern utility chains.  
Development Needs: The reliance on a certificate-based authority system for verifying folding work introduces a centralization vector. Transitioning to a fully trustless, on-chain verification oracle for folding contributions is the critical development step needed to modernize the protocol.

### **5\. Ergo (ERG)**

Description: Ergo utilizes the Autolykos2 algorithm, a memory-hard PoW designed to be ASIC-resistant and friendly to consumer GPUs. While primarily a financial ledger, its extended UTXO model (eUTXO) enables complex "Sigma protocols" (non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs). Ergo is exploring sub-pool mechanisms for useful workloads, specifically utilizing mining power for oracle data processing and light-client verification (NiPoPoWs).8  
Current Practicality: A robust DeFi ecosystem exists on Ergo. Its "useful work" is currently focused on internal network hygiene—securing light clients and data inputs—rather than external scientific compute, though the architecture is flexible enough to support expansion.  
Development Needs: The complexity of the eUTXO model creates a steep learning curve for developers. Fostering a developer ecosystem that can leverage this model for off-chain compute verification and building bridges to EVM chains are key priorities.

### **6\. Flux (FLUX)**

Description: Flux provides a decentralized computational network offering an "AWS-like" experience for deploying hard-coded Dockerized applications. It utilizes a Proof-of-Useful-Work model where node operators must prove they provide enterprise-grade hardware (CPU, RAM, SSD) to host real web requests, game servers, and dApps.9  
Current Practicality: Flux is one of the few projects with high utility, hosting thousands of dApps, including front-ends for other blockchains and Minecraft servers. It competes directly with Web2 cloud providers in the niche of censorship-resistant hosting.  
Development Needs: The network is currently expanding into "PoUW Phase 2," which specifically targets GPU workloads for AI training. Reducing the technical complexity for node operators and improving the fiat-on-ramp for enterprise clients are critical for mass adoption.  
URL/Repo: https://runonflux.io/

### **7\. Primecoin (XPM)**

Description: A pioneer in the field, Primecoin’s PoW algorithm searches for Cunningham chains (sequences of prime numbers). These primes have specific mathematical significance for number theory and cryptography. The security of the network is directly tied to the discovery of these scientific curiosities, rather than arbitrary hashing.8  
Current Practicality: While mathematically interesting, the "utility" is somewhat abstract compared to rendering or AI. The chain functions reliably as a currency, but the scientific output (prime number lists) has limited commercial demand outside of academic circles.  
Development Needs: Modernizing the codebase (it is an older Bitcoin fork) is essential. Pivoting the prime search to identify specific cryptographic primes needed for RSA encryption or Zero-Knowledge proof setups could renew the protocol's relevance.  
URL/Repo: https://primecoin.io/

### **8\. Kaspa (KAS)**

Description: Kaspa implements the GHOSTDAG protocol, a generalization of Bitcoin consensus that allows for parallel blocks and incredibly fast confirmation times. While strictly Proof-of-Work, its "usefulness" lies in solving the scalability trilemma without sharding or centralization. It is actively exploring "optical mining," which could transition the network to solving NP-hard optical optimization problems.10  
Current Practicality: The high transaction throughput makes it highly practical for payments and L2 settlement. The shift to useful optical computing remains in the R\&D stage, with the current utility being the extreme speed of the ledger itself.  
Development Needs: Smart contract implementation (currently limited) is required to build a utility ecosystem around the fast ledger. The successful integration of optical PoW hardware is the major long-term development milestone.  
URL/Repo: https://kaspa.org/

### **9\. Spacemesh (SMH)**

Description: Spacemesh uses "Proof of Space-Time" (PoST), enabling users to mine with hard drive space. The protocol is designed to be race-free, meaning rewards are proportional to storage committed over time, not electricity burned. This creates a "useful" reservoir of storage availability.8  
Current Practicality: The Mainnet is live with a growing community of home miners utilizing standard HDDs. The utility of the storage is currently for consensus eligibility, but the capacity exists for future data hosting.  
Development Needs: Developing a data availability layer to allow the committed space to store actual user data (similar to Filecoin) would bridge the protocol from consensus-only to utility-backed.  
URL/Repo: https://spacemesh.io/

### **10\. Chia (XCH)**

Description: Founded by Bram Cohen (creator of BitTorrent), Chia uses Proof of Space and Time. Farmers allocate storage (plots) to validate the network. The "useful" aspect is the move away from energy-intensive ASIC mining to storage-based security, utilizing the secure Chialisp programming language for smart transactions.8  
Current Practicality: Highly functional and "green" compared to Bitcoin. It has gained traction in enterprise and government partnerships (e.g., carbon credit tracking) due to its compliance-friendly posture and secure language.  
Development Needs: The "plotting" process (creating the storage files) is energy-intensive initially. Reducing this cost and increasing the DeFi liquidity on the network are key needs to drive broader adoption.  
URL/Repo: https://www.chia.net/

### **11\. Ravencoin (RVN)**

Description: A Bitcoin fork specialized for asset transfer. It uses the KAWPOW algorithm, which is ASIC-resistant and memory-hard to keep mining decentralized. Its specific utility is the tokenization of physical assets (securities, real estate) with compliant features like messaging and voting built into the protocol layer.5  
Current Practicality: Widely used for tokenizing small-scale assets and security tokens. The platform is stable and follows Bitcoin’s fair launch principles, earning it a loyal community.  
Development Needs: Ravencoin lacks the Turing-complete programmability of Ethereum. Adding a layer for complex logic or bridging to smart contract chains is necessary for advanced financial instruments.  
URL/Repo: https://ravencoin.org/

### **12\. Kadena (KDA)**

Description: Kadena weaves multiple parallel PoW chains (Chainweb) to achieve infinite scalability. As network demand grows, more chains are added to the braid. The utility here is the solving of the throughput bottleneck inherent in PoW without sacrificing security or decentralization.  
Current Practicality: Proven scalability in production. The ecosystem is growing with DEXs and NFT marketplaces, though it remains smaller than L2 solutions on Ethereum.  
Development Needs: Adoption of its Pact smart contract language is the primary bottleneck, as it differs from Solidity. Developer tooling and education are critical needs.  
URL/Repo: https://kadena.io/

### **13\. Verus Coin (VRSC)**

Description: Verus employs "Proof of Power," a hybrid of PoW and PoS. Its unique algorithm, VerusHash, is designed to equalize hardware (CPU/GPU/FPGA) to democratize mining. It features "Public Blockchains as a Service" (PBaaS), allowing for useful interoperability and a robust identity system (VerusID).8  
Current Practicality: The identity protocol is highly functional and self-sovereign. The "useful" aspect is the efficient bridging and identity sovereignty it provides, rather than raw scientific compute.  
Development Needs: UI/UX improvements are significant needs; the wallet and identity systems are powerful but complex for average users to navigate.  
URL/Repo: https://verus.io/

### **14\. Signum (SIGNA)**

Description: Formerly Burstcoin, Signum is the first Proof-of-Capacity coin. It uses hard drive space for mining. Signum has evolved to include smart contracts and token assets on a sustainable, low-energy chain.  
Current Practicality: Extremely low energy footprint. It functions well as a payment and basic smart contract layer but suffers from low liquidity and market attention compared to newer storage chains.  
Development Needs: Rebranding and marketing are needed to differentiate from newer storage chains (Chia/Filecoin). It needs to attract DeFi builders to utilize its capacity.  
URL/Repo: https://signum.network/

### **15\. Saito (SAITO)**

Description: Saito addresses the "tragedy of the commons" in blockchain infrastructure by rewarding nodes for routing data, not just mining blocks. This ensures that the heavy lifting of serving terabytes of blockchain data is incentivized—a form of "Proof of Routing" or useful infrastructure work.  
Current Practicality: The network handles high-throughput gaming and data applications (like Twilight Struggle on-chain). The economic model effectively fixes the "Infura problem" of centralized endpoints.  
Development Needs: The project is transitioning from its current Rust-based implementation to a fully decentralized mainnet with broader validator participation.

**Conclusion**

The 100 protocols detailed above represent a decisive shift in the blockchain industry. We are witnessing the end of the "casino era" of pure speculation and the beginning of the "utility era."

1. **Energy is no longer just security**: In PoUW, energy expenditure produces intelligence (Qubic, Dynex).  
2. **Infrastructure is crowd-funded**: In DePIN, CAPEX is distributed, allowing networks (Helium, Hivemapper) to scale faster than centralized competitors.  
3. **Science is liquid**: In DeSci, intellectual property becomes a tradable, liquid asset (VitaDAO), accelerating funding velocity.  
4. **AI is accountable**: In the Agentic Economy (Bittensor, AI16Z), AI is not a black box owned by Big Tech, but a verifiable commodity owned by the commons.

While many of these projects face significant "Development Needs"—primarily regarding scalability, verification latency, and user experience—the trajectory is clear. The next generation of trillion-dollar protocols will likely be found in this list of Information-Backed Currencies, as they bridge the digital ledger with the physical and intellectual reality of our world.
