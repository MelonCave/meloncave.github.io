There are all kinds of tools to help with the tedious process of understanding large codebases now ... AI is not just for autocomplete, vibe coding and disposable code, although [**disposable code is most definitely here to stay**, ***if only because AI can understand disposable code and ensure that it gets disposed or transformed into durable code***](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/disposable-code-is-here-to-stay)  ... if you want an example, you can [use something like Cognition Devin's DeepWiki to interrogate repo](https://deepwiki.com/) and *there will be even better tools*  as you refactor code and overhaul it and completely upgrade and improve a codebase -- sometimes that will mean starting from scratch, but understanding the gist of what the code was attempting to accomplish and any hidden, latent essential features ... there's a lot of disposable code that is just not worth the effort to understand and basically will never be important enough even for an AI to parse it, i.e. its uselessness will drive its irrelevance and effectively its disposal.

We see the same thing in the realm of engineering and science ... there will always be a role for engineering texts and peer-reviewed research ... there will be a role for arXiv vs hackery ... but hackery is here to stay ... it's important to see something like arXiv, not as newest, hottest, most bleeding-edge concept invention as an attempt to refactor and clean up a generalized cloud of vaporous hackery ... to get concepts formalized, reviewed and ALMOST REPRODUCIBLY work ... on the path to something that **DEPENDABLY**, REPRODUCIBLY works ... it's not a choice between disposable hackery and formalized, peer-reviewed dependable principles ... both have a role ... so both are here to stay ... and both will always be evolving.

It's certainly [worth exploring DeepWiki and the realm of DeepWiki-like tools](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_734a8d6f-e1a5-4561-9dd2-e30638866850) ... and [explore the realm of these tools in a meta sense](https://gemini.google.com/share/322c2df2d6fa) and then maybe diving deeper, philosophically [understanding what code reviews are for, how a tool like DeepWiki works and serves as a transformative tool for getting teams/dev communities up to speed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLZSTZW6uljrjmgILRyWGrA6u1b0_us3sDKqDvub5MI/edit?usp=sharing), possibly how the whole shebang still falls short -- but mostly understanding how it works ... and how it can or needs to be extended to enable coding in public ... and, in another direction, how this process can be used beyond the realm of helping understand large codebases in GitHub repos, eg how it can be used to help understand large bodies of research ... and how it can be used to help understand large bodies of knowledge in general ... this takes us into the realm of looking at repos of emerging tools such as [DeepWiki RS](https://github.com/sopaco/deepwiki-rs) and [Litho Book](https://github.com/sopaco/litho-book) and [Saga Reader](https://github.com/sopaco/saga-reader), a modern, cross-platform application built on top of Rust, Tauri & Svelte which takes us back to what we are attempting to do with mdBook and a tool like GitButler.
