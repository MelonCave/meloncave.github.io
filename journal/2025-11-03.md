AI, like all things computational, is just a tool ... you could say that it has to be a matter of garbage in garbage out ... but AI is monitorable, so it actually ***can*** ingest adulterated-food or garbage-tainted inputs and be used to filter or improve the quality not just the outputs, but to sort, filter, make sense of inference data ... and even, over time, to do a better job of selecting data for LLM training.

Of course, AI are susceptible to bad data ... but that's increasingly well-known to AI engineers, so perhaps, hopefully the next generations of AI tools will be able to give some indication of how *cooked* the data inputs are OR how susceptible the tools are to imperfect data.

Frankly, it is going to be way too much to ask for to expect that we will ever have perfect data ... BUT that does not mean that the inputs can be improved ... it's just that *PRACTICALLY* there are all kinds of different reasons why data inputs are hokieAF or suspicious ... but ***HOW*** suspicious? 

And WHO makes that call? WHO decides what the outliers are? Who decides what goes into the hopper? Much of the data that AI are trained on starts off being erroneous or designed to propagandize rather than inform ... so ***PERSONAL*** knowledge management is a matter of ***PERSONAL*** information and **data** management that PRACTICALLY acknowledges a degree of humility and skepticism ... *everything we think we ***know*** should be regarded as if it were a dream or hallucination.

What computer scientists and AI/ML engineers know about technology that they are ***personally*** familiar with is less prone to this kind of error and distortion -- it's not perfect, but there are tools to know more about what we can't know. Computerized data visualization tools are pretty good and maybe getting better at illustrating how an AI works or doesn't ... but it's like AI being applied to site reliability engineering, *the state of the toolchains and technologies to make things reliable and dependable is ALWAYS in a state of catching up to the superficiality of gee whizz technologies ... but ***somebody*** gets how massive this problem is, so the 0.5, pre 1.0 versions of observability, SRE and monitoring tools are out there to clean up the messes of the AI rev 4.5 or 5.0.*

*Not that one immediately understands exactly how to put the tools to practical use* ***AT FIRST*** ... but it is kind of important to look into [visualizations, virtual exhibits, and experimental tools for exploring research](https://www.alphaxiv.org/labs) to initiate one's thinking into what kinds of visualization tools are possible and are being built ... one can see that this tool being developed and enhanced somewhat to help researchers or developers explore how to improve, change, tweak, perturbate LLMs for more efficient learning or more robust convergence ... for example, one can currently explore tensor operations in a 3D interactive environment, [flying through Llama 8B to visualize scale in a step-by-step fashion](https://www.alphaxiv.org/labs/fly-through-llama) iteratively tweaking/stepping through code and viewing each matrix operation and  understanding effects on the tensor operation traces.
