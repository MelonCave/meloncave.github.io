AI, like all things computational, is a matter of garbage in garbage out ... it's not so much that AI are susceptible to bad data -- it's perhaps that hopefully the next generations of AI tools will be able to give some indication of how *cooked* the data inputs are OR how susceptible the tools are to imperfect data ... it may be too much to ask for to expect that we will ever have perfect data ... it can and should be better, of course -- but PRACTICALLY there are all kinds of different reasons why data inputs are hokieAF or suspicious ... but how suspicious? WHO decides what the outliers are? Who decides what goes into the hopper? Much of the data that AI are trained on starts off being erroneous or designed to propagandize rather than inform ... but what computer scientists and AI/ML engineers know about their own technology is less prone to this kind of error and distortion. As a result, computerized data visualization tools are particularly good at illustrating how an AI works or doesn't.

*Not that one immediately understands exactly how to put the tools to practical use* ***AT FIRST*** ... but it is kind of important to look into [visualizations, virtual exhibits, and experimental tools for exploring research](https://www.alphaxiv.org/labs) to initiate one's thinking into what kinds of visualization tools are possible and are being built ... one can see that this tool being developed and enhanced somewhat to help researchers or developers explore how to improve, change, tweak, perturbate LLMs for more efficient learning or more robust convergence ... for example, one can currently explore tensor operations in a 3D interactive environment, [flying through Llama 8B to visualize scale in a step-by-step fashion](https://www.alphaxiv.org/labs/fly-through-llama) iteratively tweaking/stepping through code and viewing each matrix operation and  understanding effects on the tensor operation traces.
