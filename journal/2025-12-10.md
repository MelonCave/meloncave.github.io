The somatosensory cortex is a critical area of research in emerging technological and neuroscientific fields because of its primary role in processing bodily sensations such as touch, pressure, temperature, and pain. Research explores its importance in enhancing human-computer interaction, aiding rehabilitation, and understanding neuroplasticity in areas including: 
Virtual Reality (VR): The somatosensory cortex is central to research on creating realistic and immersive VR experiences by integrating haptic (touch) and thermal feedback.
Immersion and Embodiment: Haptic feedback devices (like specialized gloves or suits) stimulate skin receptors to simulate touch pressure, allowing users to "feel" virtual objects. This research investigates how the brain integrates these artificial sensory inputs to enhance a user's sense of presence and "body ownership" over a virtual limb or avatar.
Training and Simulation: The incorporation of haptics into VR surgical simulators generally enhances performance and complements traditional teaching methods, leveraging somatosensory processing for skill acquisition.
Pain Attenuation: VR exposure is used in clinical settings to attenuate pain ("VR-induced analgesia"), with studies imaging the brain to understand how the somatosensory cortex's pain-processing role is inhibited during immersive experiences.
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): The somatosensory cortex is vital in developing bidirectional BCIs that restore sensory feedback, particularly for individuals with paralysis or amputations using neuroprosthetics.
Restoring Sensation: Researchers use direct cortical stimulation (DCS) via implanted electrodes to evoke artificial tactile percepts (e.g., a "pins and needles" sensation or a "buzz") in specific body regions.
Closed-Loop Control: Integrating this artificial somatosensory feedback into BCIs creates a "closed-loop system," improving user control, enhancing performance in motor tasks, and providing a more intuitive human-machine interaction. Studies have found that while cortical stimulation works, reaction times may be slower than natural haptic touch, which has implications for future device design.
Online Learning (and Neuroplasticity): Research into learning, particularly motor skill acquisition and sensory perception, heavily involves the somatosensory cortex's capacity for neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to reorganize itself).
Sensory Reorganization: Studies show that focused somatosensory training, such as learning Braille by touch, can induce rapid functional and structural changes in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1).
Media and Engagement: Research using EEG procedures notes that observing motor actions in a real-world setting yields a stronger somatosensory (Mu rhythm) response than observing the same actions on a screen, which is highly relevant for designing effective online learning modules and virtual reality educational content.
Sensorimotor Mismatch: VR paradigms are used to investigate how the somatosensory cortex responds to spatial incongruency between motor commands and sensory feedback, contributing to the understanding of sensorimotor learning and rehabilitation. 

Today, several companies including Blackrock Neurotech, BrainGate, ClearPoint Neuro, Synchron, Neuralink and more are [competing to bring brain-computer interface (BCI) technology into the marketplace](https://www.sensortips.com/featured/how-do-brain-computer-interfaces-use-sensors/). Neuralink, an Elon Musk venture, is developing an implant that would be placed in the brain through a robot-assisted procedure. The implant has a six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) for tracking head movement and more sensors for measurables like temperature, as well as a Bluetooth antenna to connect with a smartphone app.
