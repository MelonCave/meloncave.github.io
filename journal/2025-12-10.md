### Why Use Gel? (FLEX 2 Gel)
Opt for the Gel version if your work prioritizes **maximum signal quality and reliability in demanding, extended sessions**. Gel electrodes excel in creating a low-impedance barrier between the scalp and sensors, reducing noise and artifacts—especially on varied scalp types (e.g., thicker hair or drier skin). This leads to:
- **Higher Reproducibility**: Ideal for precise, granular data in whole-brain studies, like advanced ERP mapping or long-term monitoring of cognitive rewiring.
- **Extended Usability**: Refillable gel maintains consistent performance over hours without frequent adjustments, minimizing data loss in prolonged experiments.
- **Research-Grade Precision**: Sintered Ag/AgCl construction with gel ensures superior temporal resolution (256 SPS downsampled from 2048 Hz), making it better for applications requiring uncompressed, high-fidelity outputs.

It's worth the $300 premium if you're in a controlled lab setting or need publication-ready data, but it involves more preparation (mixing/applying gel) compared to saline.

### Why Use Saline? (FLEX 2 Saline)
Choose the Saline version for **affordability, ease, and flexibility in dynamic or field-based research**. Saline-soaked felts provide a wet conductive medium that's simpler to manage, offering:
- **Quick Setup and Minimal Downtime**: Easy rear-refill design allows rehydration without removing the cap, perfect for iterative tests or mobile scenarios (e.g., walking through designed spaces for neuroarchitecture studies).
- **Cost-Effective Performance**: Delivers comparable research-grade EEG (validated against pro systems) at a lower price, with ample felts (100 included) for repeated use without extras.
- **User-Friendly for Broader Applications**: Less messy than gel, enhancing comfort in non-lab environments like BCI prototyping or real-world brain activity tracking during daily practices.

Saline is the go-to for beginners, budget-conscious users, or scenarios where portability trumps ultra-premium fidelity—saving time on maintenance while still capturing reliable ERPs and oscillations.
