## [Efficient Note-Taking in Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/getting-started/note-taking-in-foam.md#writing-effective-notes) 

Minimizing context-switchings builds upon using [essential VS Code keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings) and even goes beyond the [Foam extension's VS Code shortcuts for note-taking](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/getting-started/note-taking-in-foam.md#keyboard-shortcuts). If one wants to optimize the machine-readability for automating notes in the future, it's necessary to to get practice with using things like using [note properties](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/note-properties.md), [templates](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/templates.md), and [graph visualization](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/graph-view.md). As with most tools, [**Foam** *is like a bathtub -- what you get out of it depends on* ***what you put into it.***](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/index.md).
