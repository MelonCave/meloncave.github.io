For the balance of October, we will go back to most basic of the basics, focused on [more effective and efficient note-taking](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/getting-started/note-taking-in-foam.md#writing-effective-notes) for the Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives knowledge management framework using the Foam extension for VS Code.

# Simplification and continuous improvment/refocus/refactoring in PKM dev methodology

First, we focus our review/refactoring/daily discipline for VS Code, to minimizing context-switchings builds upon using [essential VS Code keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings) and even goes beyond the [Foam extension's VS Code shortcuts for note-taking](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/getting-started/note-taking-in-foam.md#keyboard-shortcuts). 

As with the use of any tool, [using **Foam** *is like a bathtub -- what you get out of it depends on* ***what you put into it.***](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/index.md) -- we want to deliberately take some time to sharpen our skillset with these most basic facets of how the tool is used. If one wants to optimize the machine-readability for automating notes in the future, it's necessary to to get practice with using things like using [note properties](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/note-properties.md), [templates](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/templates.md), and [graph visualization](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/graph-view.md).
