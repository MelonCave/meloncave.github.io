We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-10-05.md) to build out Projects, completely RETHINKING P.A.R.A. structured PKE workflows ... by continuing [[2015-10-09]] yesteday's examination of the [**nomadic portfolio lifestyle**, including side-hustles, the gig economy, startups and co-founders, awareness of the funding and acquhire issues as well as navigation of the project talent aquistion landscape](https://ancientguy.github.io/PKM/2.Areas/12PortfolioLifestyle.html). 

The REASON that we build in public, participate in open source communities, and similar activities is about intelligence gathering for INVESTING in projects that have the capacity to scale and return 500X or 1000X returns over the next decade or two. We build in public to ATTRACT intelligence; to compete not just to find those who are better, even 10X better in every dimension, but in order to flush out the entities that are 100X or ideally even 10,000X better ... we're hunting for investment opportunities, while building something that allows us to understand the finer points why those entities are so much better.

This is a distinctive difference that bears repeating and reiteration. The big reason for building ventures in public is not exactly the venture or the open source technology/community itself, although we need to be serious about that stuff in order to learn.  In the larger reality, the **point of competitively building out ventures is intelligence gathering**, to understand the competitiors well enough to either beat them OR, most likely, to join them and invest in their success. This is ABSOLUTELY NOT about understanding technologies or technical industry trends or even management priniciples -- it's about understanding the FULL LEADERSHIP philosophy and the potential for continued growth by the leaders and their crew behind successful technologies and winning projects ... it's about understanding the leadership of Jen-Hsun Huang [and Charles Liang Chien-Hou, Morris Chang Chung-mou and others in the circle of leaders from Taiwan] and Elon Musk [and the kind of entrepreneus he associates with, such as Peter Thiel, Alex Karp and Palmer Luckey] and taking lessons from their lives ... RATHER than understanding GPUs or AI hardware OR space exploration or even something like the need to return X to its roots.
