As we [mentioned yesterday on Nov 6th]((https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-11-06.md)), we do not want knowledge exploration that is merely random or blindly stumbling around ... we want a **navigable** map, which might portray things according to an ordering that might be changing and different -- but an ordering that makes some sense per what others care about in the world.

We probably want to incentivize our exploration, to make it more of a playful knowledge exploration game ... but to allow the incentives, weights to reflect changes that are happening.  

We're into **ludic** economics, like auctions, ways to accelerate the negotiation and build trust as in customer loyalty programs. By *ludic*, we mean those kinds of things that are engaging or relate to play or playfulness in a positive way, ie ***DON'T BE EVIL!!!*** We don't want customers, investors, employees to feel as if their companies, information systems and recommendation engines are playing games with customers/investors/employees as pawns OR are using *the game* as a way to get over on the customers/investors/employees on the humans ... it's increasingly important, because we all want/need more from a transaction than just the good / money exchanges in that transaction ... not just for the game of it ... there's more going on!

You don't exactly *need* to [delve into the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) and the Shared Payment Token, co-developed by Stripe and OpenAI](#strategic-analysis-of-the-agentic-commerce-protocol-and-the-emerging-standards-for-ai-driven-payments) ... but there's more to this than just enabling something like an Instant Checkout feature in ChatGPT, *which is not that much different from the *Buy It Now!* insta-purchase button that Amazon made famous ... because people are attracted to that kind of convenience*. 

This is NOT about understanding bleeding edge things or hyper-trendy trends ... this is far more mainstream already, because agentic commerce gives the players in the game a feeling of having much more complete information and it's THEIR REQUESTED information, ie not from a recommendation engine pushing pop-up adds based on tracking your web cookies. SMARTER commerce is really about SMARTER allocation of time, resources, capital in pursuit of something that better fits a more wisely considered future need.  *SMARTER COMMERCE is HIGHLY DISRUPTIVE because all kinds of different things that people used to think they need ... they have learned they don't actually need those things anymore ... and things also means stuff that companies need, like employees or production facilities or logistics.* **SMARTER COMMERCE is HIGHLY DISRUPTIVE.**

To understand *games* in goods, services, capital, data/compute, talent and how these markets morphing, getting smarter ... so that *you don't get played by the game*, you may want to spend a moment or two on [weensy bit of a overview or shallow dive in that kind of material](https://gemini.google.com/share/9f213d47658b) probably helps a lot, when it comes to understanding the lay of the land ... you will definitely want to go beyond just the one side presented in the [technical marketing overview developed by Stripe](https://youtu.be/l7r9jW2nEOI).

The reason that we prefer ludic economics or why want playfulness is NOT adding a bogus feature or a nifty twist or a stupid childish game -- instead, this game matters because it's about ***greater value, better understanding of priorities, improved efficiency of the transaction, and a degree of security*** for freedom from hassles of fraud ... thus about customer satisfaction, assured trust, reputation, loyalty and better antcipating the development of what will be needed in the future.

Deeper engagement is really extremely serious stuff ... beyond just seemingly silly "games" that used to be part of improving commerce and transportations like old school coupons or Gold Bond / S&H GreenStamps or frequent flyer miles or credit card loyalty points ... or even games that about catching game-cheaters or fraud detection of fraudsters who test strategies inside the normal, small transactions of repeat, trusting customers ... it's not JUST about repeat customers OR encouraging customer referrals or building good will and others things that drive order acquisition costs to near zero ... it is really about the much, much deeper game of customer loyalty ... how does the "game" satisfy the customer, ie make the customers/investors/employees feel like they are ["***winning***"](https://x.com/patrickc/status/1985468907747172552) relative to how persons would be doing if they didn't participate in the game. 

**This is not just hype! Doubters really need to spend some time pondering why advanced commerce with sophisticated logistics and payment systems and much more well-developed capital markets continue to be so much more sustainably high growth environments that decade-after-decade continue to attract more investment and the highest levels of talent.** 

# Strategic Analysis of the Agentic Commerce Protocol and the Emerging Standards for AI-Driven Payments

The emergence of AI-driven conversational interfaces, such as ChatGPT, is all about the battle for the agentic AI storefront. Given that people are making agentic AI part of their where their mind is, this part of agentic AI lifestyles is probably the most significant architectural shift in digital commerce since the introduction of the smartphone ... with Google's location based services and Amazon's search of the universe of products available upon delivery defining points on the trajectory before smartphones and AI assistants. 

AI agents are rapidly transforming from informational assistants into autonomous economic actors, moving the point of discovery and the point of purchase away from traditional merchant websites and into a conversational interface. This paradigm shift, termed "agentic commerce," has created a critical new infrastructure requirement and ignited a strategic standards war to define the protocols that will govern this nascent economy.

The battle is not merely over payment processing; it is a competition to define the foundational infrastructure for agent-driven trust, identity, and transactions. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) and its associated Shared Payment Token (SPT) co-developed by Stripe and OpenAI. It deconstructs the security philosophy underpinning this standard and provides a comprehensive analysis of the alternatives and the strategic "takes" of all primary competitors.

Two dominant and divergent philosophies have emerged:

1. **The Pragmatic/Gateway Model (OpenAI/Stripe's ACP):** This approach prioritizes rapid, scalable adoption by building a secure, merchant-friendly "bridge" that layers on top of existing e-commerce infrastructure. It is a tactical solution designed to immediately enable conversational checkouts within a semi-centralized trust model.  
2. **The Structural/Trust Model (Google's AP2):** This approach, backed by a broad coalition, aims to build a new, universal, and cryptographically-verifiable trust framework from the ground up. It is a long-term, strategic solution designed for a fully autonomous, decentralized agentic economy.

These two philosophies are NOT exactly in competition with one another ... it's maybe even likely that both could be implemented for similar but slightly different use cases or user populations, analogous to the way that different authorization and authentication protocols evolved for implementation of security [and then 2FA] of web-based platforms.

This report analyzes the technical architectures of these competing standards, maps the complex web of alliances, and assesses the divergent strategies of the key players. The competitive landscape is not a simple binary choice but is fragmenting into a multi-layer "trust stack" involving context (Anthropic's MCP), authentication (Cloudflare's Web Bot Auth), verification (Visa's TAP and Mastercard's Agent Pay), and payment (ACP/AP2). The strategic alignments of key payment processors—such as PayPal's "protocol neutrality," Adyen's enterprise-focused bet on AP2, and Block's conspicuous absence—reveal the high-stakes nature of this competition to build the rails for the next generation of commerce.

## **I. Analysis of the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) and Shared Payment Token (SPT)**

The Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) is the standard co-developed by Stripe and OpenAI to enable the "Instant Checkout" feature within ChatGPT, representing the first large-scale implementation of agentic commerce.1

### **I.A. Protocol Architecture and Merchant-Centric Design**

ACP is defined as an open-source standard (Apache 2.0 license) designed to create a "common language" for programmatic commerce flows between three parties: buyers, their AI agents, and businesses.8

The protocol's design is fundamentally "merchant-friendly" and architected to drive rapid adoption by minimizing integration friction.2 This is achieved through two core tenets:

1. **Merchant Control:** The protocol explicitly ensures that the business remains the **merchant of record**.2 This is a critical design choice, as it guarantees that merchants retain control over their direct customer relationships, order logic, product presentation, fulfillment processes, and the full post-purchase experience.2  
2. **Pragmatic Integration:** ACP is designed to work with a business's *existing* infrastructure.2 Businesses are not required to "rebuild their stack".2 Instead, they implement the protocol by creating agent-facing endpoints (via a traditional REST API or a Model Context Protocol server) that integrate directly with their current commerce backend and payment processor.8

Furthermore, the protocol is designed for flexibility, supporting complex commerce flows beyond simple, single-item purchases. It can handle physical and digital goods, recurring subscriptions, and asynchronous purchases where fulfillment is not immediate.2

### **I.B. The "Instant Checkout" Flow Deconstructed: A Developer's View**

"Instant Checkout" is the first branded *implementation* of the ACP standard, powering the ability to buy products from merchants like Etsy and Shopify directly within the ChatGPT interface.1

From a developer's perspective, enabling this feature requires implementing three distinct specifications defined by OpenAI 9:

1. **Product Feed Spec:** The merchant must first provide a structured product feed (e.g., TSV, CSV, XML, JSON). This feed provides the AI agent with the necessary, up-to-date information on product details, pricing, inventory, and fulfillment options, allowing it to accurately surface products in response to user queries.9  
2. **Agentic Checkout Spec:** This is the core API that the merchant must build. It consists of a series of REST endpoints for managing a checkout\_session. The flow is conversational:  
   * The agent first calls POST /checkout\_sessions to create a new cart, sending the initial item list. The merchant's server validates this and returns the full, authoritative cart state.9  
   * As the user adds information (e.g., a fulfillment address or shipping choice), the agent calls POST /checkout\_sessions/{checkout\_session\_id} to update the session. The merchant's server recalculates taxes, shipping, etc., and returns the updated state.9  
   * Finally, to buy, the agent calls POST /checkout\_sessions/{checkout\_session\_id}/complete, passing the secure payment credential. The merchant's server is responsible for all final validation, risk analysis, and initiating the charge.9  
3. **Delegated Payment Spec:** This is the security-critical specification that allows the agent to facilitate the payment without ever handling sensitive payment credentials. The first and primary implementation of this spec is Stripe's Shared Payment Token.9

### **I.C. Core Security Primitive: The Shared Payment Token (SPT)**

The Shared Payment Token (SPT) is Stripe's answer to the Delegated Payment Spec.9 It is a new payment primitive that allows an application like ChatGPT to initiate a payment without ever exposing the user's underlying payment credentials, such as a full credit card number (Primary Account Number, or PAN).1

The technical tokenization flow is managed in a way that segregates duties and contains risk 19:

1. **Buyer & Agent:** The buyer provides their payment method (e.g., a credit card or Stripe's Link) to the AI agent (ChatGPT), where it is saved and vaulted by the payment provider (Stripe).1  
2. **Agent (Token Creation):** When the buyer confirms the purchase, the agent (OpenAI) makes an API call *to Stripe* to create a SharedPaymentToken. This action issues a temporary, *scoped grant* of the buyer's vaulted PaymentMethod.19  
3. **Seller (Token Usage):** The agent passes this SPT (a string, e.g., spt\_123...) to the merchant's /complete endpoint.9 The seller then uses this SPT in their *own* backend API call *to Stripe* to create and confirm a PaymentIntent, which finalizes the charge.1

The security of this model is not based on verifying the agent's identity, but on a "least-privilege" credential. The SPT's power is strictly defined by its *scoping*, which is enforced by the payment provider (Stripe).1 The technical mechanism for this is the allowance object within the Delegated Payment Spec.

The following table summarizes the key technical components of the ACP implementation and the specific security fields that define the SPT's limited scope.

---

**Table 1: ACP Technical Implementation & Security Scoping**

**Part A: Agentic Checkout Spec (Key Merchant Endpoints)** 9

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| /checkout\_sessions | POST | **Create Session:** Agent sends cart items. Merchant's server validates and returns the full, authoritative cart state. |
| /checkout\_sessions/{id} | POST | **Update Session:** Agent sends new user info (e.g., shipping address, fulfillment option). Merchant recalculates totals and returns updated state. |
| /checkout\_sessions/{id}/complete | POST | **Complete Checkout:** Agent finalizes the purchase and passes the secure payment token (e.g., SPT) for the merchant to process. |

**Part B: Delegated Payment Spec (Security allowance Object Fields)** 20

| Field | Type | Description & Security Implication |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| reason | String enum | Must be "one\_time". This programmatically enforces that the token is single-use and cannot be reused for other flows. |
| max\_amount | Integer | The maximum amount, in minor units, that can be charged. This prevents the token from being used for an unauthorized, larger transaction. |
| currency | String | Scopes the transaction to a specific currency (e.g., "usd"), following the ISO 4217 standard. |
| merchant\_id | String | **Critical Security Scope:** This field binds the token to a *specific merchant*. The token is useless to any other merchant if intercepted. |
| expires\_at | String | An RFC 3339 timestamp. The token is short-lived and becomes invalid after this time, mitigating replay attacks. |
| checkout\_session\_id | String | Links the payment delegation directly to the specific cart and session the user approved, ensuring contextual integrity. |

## **II. The Security Philosophy of Agent-Mediated Payments**

The design of the ACP and SPT directly addresses a fundamental shift in the information security threat model of e-commerce.

### **II.A. The Foundational Trust Problem: A New Threat Model**

The core dilemma of agentic commerce is the breakdown of the "human-in-the-loop" assumption that underpins all modern payment security protocols.21 For decades, security has been predicated on a human user directly interacting with a trusted interface, clicking "buy," and performing authentication actions (e.g., 3-D Secure).

An autonomous AI agent breaks this model, creating a new, three-pronged threat model that merchants must confront:

1. **Malicious Bots vs. Legitimate Agents:** How can a merchant's systems distinguish a legitimate, helpful AI shopping agent (like ChatGPT) from a malicious bot attempting to scrape data, test stolen credit cards, or commit fraud?.25  
2. **Agent Authorization:** How does a merchant *know* that the consumer *actually* authorized the agent to make a specific purchase? Without proof, liability in a dispute becomes untenable.10  
3. **Agent Error ("Hallucination"):** How can a merchant trust that the agent has executed the user's instructions *correctly* and not "hallucinated" an order, such as the wrong item, an incorrect quantity, or a nonsensical address?.23

Without a standard to address these risks, merchants' fraud-detection systems would simply block all agent-based traffic, suffocating the agentic commerce ecosystem before it can begin.29

### **II.B. ACP's Security Philosophy: Pragmatism and Scoped Trust**

The security philosophy of the Agentic Commerce Protocol and Shared Payment Token is one of **pragmatism and containment**.

Significantly, the ACP/SPT model *does not* attempt to definitively solve the complex, long-term problems of agent identity (threat \#1) or cryptographic proof of authorization (threat \#2). Instead, its design is a brilliant tactical solution focused on **mitigating the *damage* from these threats** while solving threat \#3 (Error) through explicit user confirmation.15

The traditional e-commerce security model is identity-based: "Prove you are you (e.g., with a password or passkey), and you will be granted access to your powerful, persistent credential (your credit card)." An autonomous agent cannot, in a cryptographically verifiable way, "be" you.

Therefore, ACP inverts the model. Its security does not depend on *who* the agent is. It depends on *what the credential (the SPT) can do*. The SPT is a perfect implementation of the **"principle of least privilege."** It is a dynamic, just-in-time, single-use credential.11 As defined in Table 1, the token is programmatically scoped to a single merchant, a maximum amount, and a one-time use within a short expiry window.1 It has *no power* outside the single transaction that the user explicitly confirmed in the chat interface.15

This is a *containment* strategy, not an *identity* strategy. It is highly effective for driving merchant adoption because it leverages Stripe's existing trust ecosystem. The message to merchants is not, "You must trust this new, unproven AI agent." The message is, "You do not need to trust the agent at all. You only need to trust this single-use, cryptographically secure token *from Stripe*, which is verifiably locked to the specific cart total the user just approved."

## **III. The Primary Alternative: Google/DeepMind's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)**

Google's "take" on agentic commerce, as requested, is a direct and philosophically divergent alternative to ACP. The **Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)**, announced by Google with a coalition of over 60 partners, is not a "bridge" but a new, foundational standard.5

### **III.A. Google's Counter-Philosophy: A Framework for Cryptographic Trust**

While ACP is a pragmatic solution for *enabling* commerce, AP2 is a structural, "enterprise-grade framework" for *governing* it.10 Its philosophy is not "containment" but "provable trust".3 Where ACP (and its partners like PayPal) aims to make agentic shopping feel like a seamless conversation 5, AP2 is described as a "legal framework for robot shoppers".5

AP2 is designed to solve the three-pronged trust problem (Authorization, Authenticity, Accountability) head-on, which it identifies as the critical blockers to a truly autonomous agent economy.10

### **III.B. Security via "Mandates": The Core of AP2**

The core security mechanism of AP2 is the **"Mandate"**.5 A Mandate is a "tamper-evident, cryptographically-signed digital contract that serves as verifiable proof of user intent".24 This system is designed to create an unambiguous, auditable chain of cryptographic proof.

This Mandate framework directly solves the three core trust problems 24:

1. **Authorization:** The chain begins with an Intent Mandate. This is created when the user first makes a request (e.g., "find me running shoes under $100"). This mandate provides the initial, auditable proof of the agent's authority and scope.24 This is especially critical for *delegated* or "human-not-present" tasks (e.g., "buy this stock if it drops below $50"), which ACP's "Instant Checkout" model does not address.22  
2. **Authenticity:** After the agent assembles a cart, the user's explicit approval signs a Cart Mandate. This cryptographically locks the *exact items and price*, ensuring "what you see is what you pay for" and preventing agent "hallucination" from causing a financial error.24  
3. **Accountability:** The complete, signed chain of mandates (Intent \-\> Cart \-\> Payment) creates a **"non-repudiable audit trail"**.22 This provides "dispute-grade evidence" for merchants, banks, and payment networks.22 It creates a clear framework for assigning liability in the event of fraud or error—a critical requirement for regulated financial institutions and global enterprises.5

### **III.C. Technical Foundations: DIDs and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**

The most significant technical divergence from ACP is AP2's foundation. ACP is built on familiar, centralized technologies: REST APIs, webhooks, and proprietary API keys.4

AP2, in contrast, is built on **W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**.4 This is not just a technical detail; it is a profound philosophical choice.

* ACP's model implies a *centralized* trust system. A merchant trusts the transaction because they trust the gateways (Stripe, OpenAI) managing the tokens and API keys.  
* AP2's DIDs/VCs model implies a *decentralized* trust system. An agent can *cryptographically prove its own authority* to any party in the ecosystem, without requiring a central gatekeeper to vouch for it.

This design reveals Google's long-term vision. They are not just building a payment rail for their own chatbot. They are building a *universal trust protocol* for a future economy of *many* interoperable agents (from Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, etc.) that need to coordinate and transact directly with one another (an Agent-to-Agent, or A2A, model).24

This distinction separates the two standards' primary use cases: ACP is a solution for "agent-assisted" commerce (where a human is present to confirm). AP2 is a solution for "agent-autonomous" commerce (where a human is not present and has delegated authority).25

### **III.D. Payment Agnosticism as a Core Strategy**

Unlike the ACP, which launched with Stripe's SPT as its native implementation, AP2 is explicitly **"payment-agnostic"**.10 It is designed as a universal trust layer that can operate over *any* payment rail, including traditional credit/debit cards, real-time bank transfers, and, notably, **stablecoins and cryptocurrencies**.10

This was a key strategic maneuver to build its broad coalition of "60+ partners".5 By not competing with the payment networks, Google enrolled them. This is how AP2's launch partners include not only card networks (Mastercard, American Express) and gateways (PayPal, Adyen) but also crypto-native companies like Coinbase.5

## **IV. Competing Frameworks and Complementary Layers (The Alternatives)**

Your query for "alternatives" reveals an ecosystem that is not a simple two-way race. The market is fragmenting into a multi-layer "trust stack," where different protocols are emerging to solve discrete pieces of the agentic commerce puzzle. Many of these "alternatives" are, in fact, complementary.

A single agentic transaction will likely soon involve multiple protocols from this stack:

* **Layer 4 (Context):** How does the agent *discover* products and data?  
* **Layer 3 (Authentication):** How does the merchant server *identify* the agent as non-malicious?  
* **Layer 2 (Verification):** How does the merchant *verify* the agent is a trusted, registered entity?  
* **Layer 1 (Payment):** How does the agent *securely pay*?

### **IV.A. Layer 4 (Context): Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

This layer represents the strategic "take" from OpenAI's chief rival, **Anthropic**. Anthropic's focus is not yet on payments, but on the *precursor* to commerce: secure, agentic access to data.

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, introduced by Anthropic in 2024, is an open standard that defines how AI agents "read and reason".40 It standardizes how agents securely connect to and query external tools and data sources, such as a company's product catalog, CRM, or internal document stores.40

MCP and payment protocols like ACP or AP2 are designed to be complementary and work hand-in-hand.38 An agent would first use **MCP** to "browse the store" (e.g., query a merchant's catalog for "red dresses in stock") and then use **ACP/AP2** to "go to the checkout" (e.g., execute the transaction for the selected dress).40

### **IV.B. Layer 3 & 2 (Authentication & Verification): The Card Networks**

This layer, which sits between context and payment, addresses the merchant's first and most basic question: "Is this traffic a good bot or a bad bot?".25 Visa and Mastercard are positioning themselves as the essential identity verifiers for the ecosystem.

* **Visa's Trusted Agent Protocol (TAP):** TAP is described as a "bouncer at the digital store's door".44 It is a framework that uses standard **HTTP Message Signatures (RFC9421)** to allow merchants to "cryptographically Verify Agent Intent".46 This allows a merchant to instantly distinguish a "legitimate, credentialed agent from an anonymous bot".45  
* **Mastercard's Agent Pay Acceptance Framework:** This is a similar solution focused on *registering* and *verifying* AI agents *before* they are permitted to transact on the Mastercard network.25 Once registered, agents are issued "agentic tokens" to make their transactions traceable and authenticated.25

Crucially, both Visa and Mastercard have designed their protocols to be **complementary** to, and interoperable with, higher-level protocols like ACP and MCP.49

The foundational technology underpinning *both* Visa's TAP and Mastercard's Agent Pay is **Cloudflare's Web Bot Auth**.25 This is the underlying IETF standard (RFC 9421\) that allows an agent to cryptographically sign its traffic.25 This provides a "no-code" path to adoption for merchants; by using a CDN like Cloudflare, merchants can "easily identify trusted agentic traffic" that has been verified by Visa or Mastercard, without deploying any new code themselves.25

## **V. Comparative Analysis and Strategic Alliances (Competitor Takes)**

This section synthesizes the preceding analysis to provide a direct answer to your query on the "takes" of all key competitors.

### **V.A. A Clash of Philosophies: ACP vs. AP2**

The central conflict in the agentic payment space is the philosophical and strategic divide between the OpenAI/Stripe (ACP) camp and the Google/Coalition (AP2) camp. ACP represents a *pragmatic, merchant-centric, speed-to-market* solution from product-first companies.3 AP2 represents a *structural, enterprise-grade, long-term* trust framework from an infrastructure-first company (Google) and a coalition of financial incumbents who demand auditability.3

The following table provides a direct strategic comparison.

---

**Table 2: Strategic & Philosophical Comparison: ACP vs. AP2**

| Feature | Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) | Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Core Philosophy** | **Pragmatism & Speed-to-Market.** A "tactical bridge" to enable agentic commerce on *existing* infrastructure.3 | **Structural Trust & Auditable.** A *new*, foundational trust framework for an autonomous agent economy.3 |
| **Security Mechanism** | **Scoped Credential (Token):** The Shared Payment Token (SPT) is *contained* by amount, merchant, and time.1 | **Signed Proof (Mandate):** A *cryptographic chain of proof* (Intent \+ Cart Mandates) ensures authorization and authenticity.22 |
| **Key Technology** | REST APIs, Webhooks, and secure, single-use Payment Tokens.4 | W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).4 |
| **Threat Model Focus** | Damage containment from "hallucination" or misuse. Assumes human-in-the-loop confirmation.15 | Solves for "Authorization, Authenticity, and Accountability".24 Built for autonomous, human-not-present tasks.33 |
| **Payment Agnosticism** | *Theoretically* open 8, but *practically* launched with and defined by Stripe's SPT.12 | *Natively* payment-agnostic. Explicitly supports cards, bank transfers, stablecoins, and crypto.10 |
| **Primary Backers** | **OpenAI, Stripe**, Shopify, Etsy.1 | **Google**, **Mastercard**, **PayPal**, **Adyen**, Coinbase, American Express, Salesforce.5 |

### **V.B. Stripe's Competitors: The Payments War**

* **Stripe:** As the co-creator of ACP, Stripe's strategy is **ecosystem lock-in**. It has positioned itself as the native, default payment infrastructure for the dominant OpenAI/ChatGPT ecosystem, a massive strategic victory.6  
* **PayPal (The "Neutral" Aggregator):** PayPal's "take" is the most complex and reveals a strategy of **"Protocol Neutrality."** As a ubiquitous digital wallet, PayPal's survival depends on being a payment option in *every* ecosystem, regardless of the underlying AI model or trust protocol. The evidence for this is overwhelming:  
  1. **ACP Partner:** PayPal has partnered with OpenAI to adopt ACP, integrating "Buy with PayPal" directly into the ChatGPT Instant Checkout flow.31  
  2. **AP2 Launch Partner:** PayPal is simultaneously a *founding collaborator* on Google's AP2.5 Its own developer blog provides a robust rationale for AP2's "Mandate" framework, citing the critical need for "dispute-grade evidence" and "verifiable, auditable" transactions.22  
  3. Mastercard Partner: PayPal is also actively piloting the Mastercard Agent Pay Acceptance Framework.60  
     PayPal is aggressively playing all sides, positioning itself as the "Switzerland" of the standards war to ensure its wallet remains the top-of-mind aggregator for consumers.  
* **Adyen:** As Stripe's primary competitor for large, global enterprise clients 64, Adyen is firmly in the **Google AP2 camp**.10 This is a strategic alignment based on its customer base. Global enterprises (e.g., airlines, large retailers) have far more complex regulatory, audit, and dispute resolution requirements than the SMEs and startups that ACP initially targets. The "dispute-grade evidence" and auditable "Mandates" of AP2 are a natural fit for this enterprise market.23  
* **Block (Square): A Conspicuous Absence:** A comprehensive review of the emerging standards and alliances reveals *no public involvement* from Block (Square) in ACP, AP2, TAP, or Agent Pay.11 This silence indicates a passive or divergent strategy. Block's business has historically been a *closed ecosystem* (Square merchant hardware paired with the consumer Cash App). This absence suggests Block is either: 1\) Ceding the open-protocol infrastructure battle to its competitors, 2\) Waiting for the standards war to settle before committing, or 3\) Pursuing a proprietary, non-interoperable agent strategy within its own closed ecosystem.

### **V.C. OpenAI's Competitors: The AI War**

* **Google/DeepMind:** Google's "take" is to counter OpenAI's first-mover advantage by building a *competing, more robust standard (AP2)*. By making it open and payment-agnostic, Google aims to commoditize the payment layer, build a broader coalition, and establish a long-term foundation for its own autonomous agent ecosystem.3  
* **Anthropic:** Anthropic's "take" is to *compete on a different layer*. It has strategically avoided a direct fight on payments, instead focusing on the "pre-commerce" **Context Layer** with its **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.40 Anthropic is building partnerships with large enterprises (e.g., Salesforce, Deloitte, Cognizant) 43 and remains payment-agnostic, with Stripe listed as just one of many partners.68 It has no "Instant Checkout" equivalent, signaling a clear focus on B2B agentic workflows, not B2C shopping.69  
* **Meta:** Meta's "take" is the classic **"Walled Garden."** Meta is ignoring *all* open protocols (ACP, AP2, MCP). Instead, it is building a *proprietary, closed-loop* **"Conversational Commerce"** ecosystem within its dominant messaging platforms: WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram.71 It is monetizing this ecosystem through its own Business AI tools, Click-to-Message ads, and proprietary in-chat payment integrations.71

The following matrix visualizes the entire competitive landscape and the strategic alignments of all key players.

---

**Table 3: Competitor Alliance and Protocol Matrix**

| Player | ACP (OpenAI/Stripe) | AP2 (Google) | Verification Layer (Visa/Mastercard) | Context Layer (MCP) | Strategy Summary |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Stripe** | **Co-Creator** | No | Partner 49 | Partner 68 | **Ecosystem Lock-in:** Driving ACP to be the native payment standard for the dominant OpenAI economy. |
| **PayPal** | **Partner** 58 | **Launch Partner** 22 | **Partner** 60 | No | **Protocol Neutrality:** Playing "Switzerland" to ensure its wallet is the ubiquitous choice in all competing ecosystems. |
| **Adyen** | No | **Launch Partner** 24 | Partner 49 | No | **Enterprise Bet:** Backing AP2's robust, auditable standard, which aligns with the needs of its large, global clients. |
| **Block (Square)** | **No** | **No** | **No** | **No** | **Closed Ecosystem:** Conspicuously absent; likely focused on its proprietary Cash App/Square ecosystem, ceding the open-protocol battle. |
| **Google** | No | **Creator** | Partner 24 | Partner 24 | **Structural Control:** Building a universal, open standard (AP2) to rival ACP and define the long-term rules for all agents. |
| **Anthropic** | Partner 68 | No | No | **Creator** | **Pre-Commerce Focus:** Competing on the *Context* (MCP) layer for enterprise agents, not consumer checkout. |
| **Meta** | No | No | No | No | **Walled Garden:** Bypassing all open protocols to build a proprietary, closed-loop "Conversational Commerce" ecosystem. |

---

## **VI. Strategic Outlook and Synthesis**

The agentic commerce landscape is not coalescing around a single "winner-take-all" protocol. Instead, the analysis reveals a fragmented but highly logical **multi-layer "trust stack"** that will likely define the future of agentic transactions. A single autonomous purchase may soon involve:

1. **Cloudflare (Web Bot Auth)** at the CDN layer to authenticate the agent's traffic.  
2. **Visa/Mastercard (TAP/Agent Pay)** at the network layer to verify the agent's registration and identity.  
3. **Anthropic (MCP)** at the context layer to serve the agent a queryable product catalog.  
4. **Google (AP2)** or **Stripe (ACP)** at the payment layer to securely process the transaction.

In the near term, **ACP has a clear adoption advantage**. It is simpler, pragmatic, and exclusively integrated with the market's dominant AI product, ChatGPT.3 This gives it an immediate and massive user base.

In the long term, **AP2 possesses the structural advantage**. Its robust architecture, built on DIDs/VCs and cryptographic "Mandates," is designed to solve the complex, high-stakes problems of authorization and accountability.5 This makes it the far more appealing standard for the *enterprise* agentic economy, for regulated industries, and for a future of truly autonomous, "human-not-present" agents.

Ultimately, the most successful and enduring players in this new economy may not be the AI models themselves, but the neutral infrastructure providers operating across all standards. The true "winners" are likely to be:

* The **"Picks and Shovels"** (Cloudflare, Visa, Mastercard) who provide the foundational, interoperable layers of authentication and verification that *all* other protocols need to function securely.  
* The **"Neutral Aggregators"** (PayPal) who have successfully pursued a protocol-agnostic strategy, ensuring their consumer-facing wallet is present at every new "agentic storefront," regardless of who built it.

For merchants and businesses, this fragmented landscape represents a new wave of integration complexity. To ensure visibility and reach, they will likely need to develop strategies and infrastructure capable of supporting multiple, parallel protocols (ACP, AP2, MCP) to transact across all the major AI ecosystems.10
