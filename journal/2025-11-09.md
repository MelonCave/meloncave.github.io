# What does history or the collective experience of analysts tell us about the exploration of knowledge?

One of the lenses that we should try to use in our management of the exploration of frontiers in knowledge involves different ways to step back and bring in a much longer-term historical perspective ... it's really about trying to understand how societies, economies, and cultures commit resources to various forms of knowledge exploration including business startup, new product development or funding for research programs and laboratories over extended periods of time, and how these commitments evolve given the success of different areas of knowledge exploration given resulting social, political, and economic changes.

In an attempt to get a handle on how we might do this in some sort of methodological basis, we have attempted to analyze the philosophical foundations, methodology, and core concepts of things like the [Strauss-Howe generational theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory), defining its 'turnings' (High, Awakening, Unraveling, Crisis) and generational archetypes. There's nothing particularly magic about this particular theory, but it does provide **starting point** for beginning to think about long-term cycles in history. A longer-term, iterative exploration of this area will be necessary, but at first, we need to identify and provide summaries for other prominent theories of generational or social cycles in Western or modern industrial societies, such as the works of Karl Mannheim (sociology of generations), José Ortega y Gasset, and cyclical demographic theories (e.g., Peter Turchin's cliodynamics). We can extend this by detailing the foundational models of historical development posed by Hegelian dialectics (thesis, antithesis, synthesis) and Marxian theory (dialectical materialism, class struggle, stages of capitalism), establishing them as a comparative baseline for linear or teleological progression versus cyclical models. Just getting a baseline of these different theories is slightly overwhelming, but there's not really a substitute for immersion in the theoretcial language these models.

After we have a degree of familiarity *from swimming in the pool of ideas*, we probably want to conduct something resembling a halfway-rigorous comparative analysis of  different theories (e.g., Strauss-Howe, Mannheim, Marx, Hegel) focusing on: (a) core drivers of historical change (e.g., class conflict, generational consciousness, demographic structures, abstract ideas); (b) philosophical assumptions (e.g., determinism vs. agency, materialism vs. idealism); (c) methodological approaches (e.g., empirical, narrative, dialectical, quantitative). Ultimately, we want to investigate the mainstream academic and statistical critiques of things like Strauss-Howe theory, examining arguments regarding its empirical validity, predictive power, and potential for confirmation bias, ie *is it actually useful or just some academic gibberish good for getting papers or books published and advancing careers of authors?* ***There's nothing wrong with ENTERTAINING "big idea", eg Gladwell's "tipping point" or Marx/Engels' communist manifesto and the money generated from books, speaking tours, conferences, podcasts or YouTube channels, but we should remember that this kind of content are MOSTLY ONLY ENTERTAINING until AFTER somebody's "big idea" has more or less entered the realm of conventional wisdom and drives commitment of capital, talent, lifelong pursuits.***

To determine usefulness, we should look at exploring how **well** these various historical theories (cyclical and linear) have been practically applied by long-term investors and political theorists for forecasting, risk assessment, and understanding long-term social and political trends. This means examining the relationship between these macro-historical theories and specific phenomena in modern financial markets and possibly investigating how models of cyclical crisis (like in Strauss-Howe or Marx) are used to explain market psychology and recurrence of hype cycles and speculative bubbles, as well as the structural roles or functions of agents such as short sellers during market dislocations.

In order to kick this off, the first step might be to ask an AI assistant to synthesize the findings into something like a starting roadmap. A comprehensive backgrounder is NOT the end or final answer, but instead only a map for understanding something about the lay of the land. A decent map for iterative study will need to BEGIN by contrasting the prominent theoretical lenses for understanding how people have thought about historical evolution, highlighting the strengths, weaknesses, and new divergent insights triggered as possible explanations for social and economic change.
