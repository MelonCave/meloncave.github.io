## Drilling deeper with middleware, going beyond shallow agents

Again today, per our [project outline](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/blob/main/journal/2025-09-23.md), we *are* thinking about automation ... but today we are thinking about how applications like “Deep Research”, "Manus", and “Claude Code” have gotten around the limitation of agents that are “shallow” and fail to plan and act over longer, more complex tasks. 

[LangChain DeepAgents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) get past this limitation by implementing a combination of four things: a planning tool, sub agents, access to a file system, and a detailed prompt. We can think about how rewriting agents works in [LangChain and LangGraph alpha 1.0](https://blog.langchain.com/langchain-langchain-1-0-alpha-releases/) give developers durable execution and fine-grained control to run complex agentic systems. 

So today, as we are thinking about automation, we can review the [Middleware basics of deep agents (planning, filesystem, sub agents) using Python](https://youtu.be/AZ6257Ya_70) and spend some time [reviewing the open source projects and open source docs of LangGraph chains and LangChain agents central to see more working examples is Python and Javascript](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/releases/langchain-v1)
