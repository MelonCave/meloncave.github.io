## BEYOND useful models, tired cliches, known root causes, likely suspects

In order to save time and frustration AND now to speed up our AI algorithms, we tend to investigate [powerful mental models that guide more efficient troubleshooting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfidJu6_Xoa31sId6ITBqskykeBvQGDYOSkYkMnshv8/edit?usp=sharing), ie so that we're n*ot just throwing mud at the wall to see what might stick*. 

[Seeking FIRST to UNDERSTAND](https://g.co/gemini/share/3023b5764f94) includes gathering information on Occam's Razor, First Principles Thinking, and the KISS principle, analyzing how these heuristics minimize unnecessary complexity and guard against cognitive biases during the initial assessment phase. We can also look into the cognitive science behind pattern recognition—how experts, non-experts and crowds use accumulated experience to quickly identify 'likely suspects' and common structural flaws. The reason that cliches become the tired old cliches that everyone's heard 1000X before is that these things get suggested over and over for a simple reason: they have worked well, or well enough and reasonably consistently. 

AI or machine learning is really, at its fundamental atomistic core, about very tedious thinking ... where AI excels, it excels by applying trillions of simple, extremely tedious calculations in a bruteforce massive compute manner. AI, in particular LLM models, have gotten *good enough* results just by using randomness to build sentences with the most likely next word and paragraphs with the most likely next sentence ... but at it's core, this comes down to depending upon a random process.  

WHY should we settle for a random process ... in fact, so that we're *not just throwing mud at the wall to see what might stick*, especially in our AI algorithms, we can think more deeply about how we would algorithmically apply the following varieties [including much more complicated varieties] of this in an optimized manner:

* Expected answers: anticipated, predicted, foreseen, probable, scheduled, certain, due, required, supposed, intended, estimated, planned
    
* Proven algorithms: epitome, exemplar, ideal, paragon, perfect type, role model, shining example, archetype, prototype, standard, classic, established, tested, verified, reliable, trustworthy

* Cliches: banality, bromide, chestnut, commonplace saying, platitude, stereotype, stock phrase, trope, adage, aphorism, maxim, motto, proverb, truism, hackneyed, overused, tired, trite

* Root causes: genesis, origin, originator, base, basis, origination, foundation, source, fountainhead, beginning, wellspring, spring, start, core, essence, heart, nucleus, reason, motive, primary cause, underlying factor

* Likely suspects: acceptable, expected, fair, feasible, inclined, possible, prone, reasonable, supposable, tending, thinkable, true, up-and-coming, verisimilar, workable, certain, foreseen, predictable, prepared for, sure

* Familiar language: in a simple language, in common language, in plain terms, in everyday language, in easy-to-understand terms, accessible language, basic terms, user-friendly terms, layman's terms, clear language, straightforward terms, understandable terms, non-specialist terms, simple terms, plain language, ordinary language, informal language, colloquial, vernacular, conversational.
