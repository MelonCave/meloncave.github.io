We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-09-29.md) to completely RETHINK P.A.R.A. structured Personal Knowledge Engineering workflows ... in addition to AI-assisted coding and knowledge workflows AND understanding something about the mfg and buildout of AI hardware ...we are noticing that much of what we **re-**learn or learn new things about comes from the unexpected, sometimes unwelcome things that we encounter in doing the smaller parts of Projects -- most of these new things are applied meta-knowledge or *knowledge-about-knowledge-management* relevant to specific things in the knowledge that we care about.

To oversimplify what this PKM P.A.R.A. structured Project of Projects is about, the objective is to dev separate repos each with its own P.A.R.A. structure, for EVERY Area in our PKM Universe ... in a very vague and general sense, the knowledge result is about the kinds of things that we expect and hope will add to our lives.

We *starting* to set up PKM Projects by preparing the Areas ... which will probably heavily feature using the full capabilities of the [Google AI Ultra smorgasbord for three months](https://one.google.com/ai) just to try as much as possible from the GoogleDeepMindAIPlex for $375 or just over $4/day, ie not planning to opt-in for a longer-term; at this point, it's just about making better AI decisions going forward.

100 Areas/Projects might seem like a lot of them, especially when we start organizing Projects around the Areas ... thus it's the kind of thing that benefits from AI tools doing lots of tedious work AND getting better at context engineering across different disciplines and sources of knowledge ... we do it in order to learn something ***PRACTICAL*** for us about the spectacular information technology and knowledgement tools/methods/automation now affordable, technically within reach and, although the Projects require some effort, the results are generally achievable.

The PKM projects will try to do an AI-assisted deep dig into topics such as the [Potager Gardening and Mediterranean Cuisine Appreciation](2.Areas/91MediterraneanCuisine.md) ... this Project consists of developing a [100-module curriculum](https://g.co/gemini/share/e0799873ca21) which can be updated/improved with experience, refined understanding and new knowledge or adaptations, eg adding [kimchi or similar fermented foods recipes from around the world](https://share.google/aimode/mjJRlbJ1bqnstjwjO). 

Working on this project presents a comprehensive journey into the world of the potager garden and the attendant Mediterranean diet cuisine, framed not merely as a set of horticultural and culinary skills, but as a holistic art appreciation course. The central thesis is that the potager garden is a living canvas, a dynamic work of art requiring daily effort, which evolves with the seasons, and provides the basis for an adaptive [based on what actually did well in the garden] cuisine it inspires is the ultimate expression of an exercise-sustainging practical art ... developing the potager garden project and taking the entire project seriously means that our nutrition will gradually become BETTER, if only because we stop taking food for granted and based our gratitude and exercise plan on how the garden was planted and tended, the produce actually harvested/preserved and the preservation techiques like fermentation used, and the meals that prepared and consumed.
