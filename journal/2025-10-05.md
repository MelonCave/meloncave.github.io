We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-09-29.md) to completely RETHINK Personal Knowledge Engineering workflows ... in addition to AI-assisted coding and knowledge workflows AND understanding something about the mfg and buildout of AI hardware ...we are noticing that much of what we learn comes from the unexpected, sometimes unwelcome things that we encounter in doing the smaller parts of Projects.

We starting to set up PKM Projects ... a lot of them, in order to learn something about the methods/automation now achievable ... simplistically, the objective of the Project is to dev separate repos each with its own P.A.R.A. structure, for EVERY Area in our PKM Universe.
