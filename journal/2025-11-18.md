[This survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpgLEOOlDPtnjlgxCaEVXaWS4pDDaUgfoXef8rOllkQ/edit?usp=sharing) presents a comprehensive overview of how Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Knowledge Graph (KG) construction across ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion. LLMs shift the paradigm from rule-based and modular pipelines toward unified, adaptive, and generative frameworks.

Since this is PRIMARILY about LEARNING HOW TO SET UP A ROCm-BASED KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING WORKSTATION USING AMD HARDWARE, it's not exactly going to pay its own way, so I need to think about the **cost ptimization** of my personal learning setup -- here's the key factoid: ***a local dual 7900 XTX runs most 70B-class tasks at <1¢/hour electricity vs. $3+/hr cloud—ideal for continuous KG evolution*** ... a [quad 32 GB AMD R7900](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/ai-r9700-pro-32gb-amd-gpu-for-ai-and-creative-workloads-benchmarks/239508) would compare well with NVIDIA AI/LLM systems currently costing 25X to 50X as much ... of course, these are NOT an an apples-to-apples comparison, so production workloads are still going to run on NVIDIA nodes in data centers ... but monkeying around with ROCm is a matter of optimizing a *good-enough-for-the-job* learning investment.

### Key Enhancements for AMD ROCm-Based Knowledge Engineering Setup
The RX 7900 XTX (24GB VRAM each) is fully supported in ROCm 6.2+ for consumer RDNA3 cards, delivering strong PyTorch performance comparable to or exceeding RTX 3090/4090 in many LLM inference tasks when optimized. Dual 7900 XTX setups can approach 80-90% of dual high-end NVIDIA performance for KG extraction and fusion with proper ROCm tuning. Evidence leans toward Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 as the most stable distro, with ROCm 6.3+ providing significant gains in FlashAttention and vLLM throughput.

### Hardware and OS Adjustments
The RX 7900 XTX GPUs will be paired with a Ryzen 9 9950X (Zen 5) for optimal PCIe 5.0 bandwidth and multi-core preprocessing in KG pipelines. Use Ubuntu 24.04 LTS for native ROCm support, enabling seamless PyTorch-ROCm integration.

### Software Stack Updates
The point of this hardware is to prioritize ROCm-native tools: PyTorch-ROCm nightly, vLLM-ROCm for high-throughput inference, and MLC-LLM or llama.cpp with HIP backend for local LLM deployment in RAG-enhanced KG construction.

### Cloud Flexibility
Keep NVIDIA-focused cloud providers (CoreWeave, RunPod) for burst training where CUDA ecosystems remain superior.

---

The shift to AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX GPUs (assuming dual cards for ~48GB total VRAM) and an AMD microprocessor fully aligns with the ROCm ecosystem as of November 2025, where consumer RDNA3 support has matured significantly since initial ROCm 5.7/6.0 rollouts. The RX 7900 XTX offers excellent value for local LLM-driven knowledge engineering—delivering 70-90% of RTX 4090 inference speeds in optimized setups (e.g., via MLC-LLM or vLLM-ROCm) at half the cost—while enabling massive VRAM for in-memory KG processing, multimodal embeddings, and long-context RAG. ROCm 6.3+ introduces 2-3x gains in attention kernels and better multi-GPU scaling, making dual 7900 XTX viable for serious ontology induction, extraction, and fusion workloads. This updated guide refines the previous recommendations for ROCm compatibility, emphasizing stability on Ubuntu while preserving NVIDIA/cloud flexibility for hybrid bursts.

#### ROCm-Optimized Hardware Configuration
Your dual RX 7900 XTX (48GB VRAM combined) is one of the best consumer options for ROCm in 2025, with official support since ROCm 5.7 and substantial improvements through 6.3/6.4. Performance in PyTorch-ROCm is now competitive for inference (often 80%+ of RTX 4090 in tokens/s for 70B models) and fine-tuning smaller adapters.

**Local Machine Enhancement**
- **GPU Setup**: Dual RX 7900 XTX – Ensure PCIe 5.0 x16 slots (or x8/x8 bifurcation) on an X670E/B650E motherboard. Use reference or high-quality AIB models (e.g., Sapphire Nitro+) with good VRAM cooling for sustained 500W+ loads during KG embedding generation.
- **CPU Recommendation**: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (16 cores/32 threads, Zen 5) or Ryzen 9 7950X3D for preprocessing-heavy tasks (e.g., dataset cleaning in Polars). Zen 5 offers AVX-512 acceleration beneficial for some ROCm kernels and future AI extensions.
- **Storage**: Same as before – PCIe 5.0 NVMe RAID 0/1 (e.g., 4TB+ total) for rapid loading of large corpora during knowledge extraction.
- **RAM**: 128-256GB DDR5-6000+ EXPO for handling billion-edge KGs in Neo4j or in-memory fusion.
- **Power & Cooling**: 1600W+ 80+ Titanium PSU (e.g., Corsair AX1600i) to support ~1000W peak draw. Custom loop or high-end AIOs essential—target <75°C VRAM temps for stability in long ROCm runs.
- **Networking**: 25GbE remains ideal for hybrid cloud syncs.

**Peripheral Hardware**
Unchanged—multiple 4K monitors, ergonomic inputs, and robust UPS/NAS backups.

**Best Practices**
- Enable FP8 KV cache in vLLM for 2x memory efficiency on long-context KG RAG.
- Use HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 if needed for gfx1100 targets.
- Quantization: GGUF via llama.cpp or NeuralMagic FP8 models.
- Multi-GPU: ROCm now supports efficient NCCL-like scaling for dual cards.

**Cost Optimization**
Local dual 7900 XTX runs most 70B-class tasks at <1¢/hour electricity vs. $3+/hr cloud—ideal for continuous KG evolution.

This AMD/ROCm-centric setup delivers a cost-effective, high-VRAM powerhouse for generative KG construction while retaining cloud NVIDIA flexibility for any remaining gaps. The ecosystem has closed much of the CUDA lead in 2025, making RX 7900 XTX an outstanding choice for serious local knowledge engineering.
