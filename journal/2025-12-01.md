# Podcastering update; AI-assistance in telling stories

We live in fantastically interesting times ... not the interesting times of war and mayhem, but the disruption of rampant innovation in things that we didn't even know we needed five or ten years ago, like [text-to-speech AI and voice-cloning](https://www.f22labs.com/blogs/13-text-to-speech-tts-solutions-in-2025/) ... although, most of these entities have not really thought through their funding models, so it is tough to keep these different AI-driven services operational, eg https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38856095 so we should not be surprised when a too-good-to-be-true service has to shut down ... however, even though persistence is tough when the cost of operating a sandbox are so high, new examples pop up every day, the entities in the ecoystem learn from one another and the choices generally better, even though the scene is characterized by chaos, disruption and deeper seismic shifts.

### Affordable Paid Software/SaaS for Audiobook and Longform Podcast Production

Based on current 2025 pricing and features, I had SuperGrok **quick-curate** a list of 25 professional-quality paid tools (including SaaS) focused on audiobook narration, editing, AI voice generation, post-production enhancement, and podcast-specific workflows. All are capped at $200/year (or equivalent one-time fee prorated annually), excluding full DAWs like Reaper (which I already use). 

Evidently, SuperGrok selected these selected these [per my request] for affordability, user reviews, and relevance to longform audio—prioritizing tools for transcription, noise reduction, AI narration, mastering, and export. Prices reflect annual billing where available for the best value; some are one-time purchases.

*Notes*: Prices are approximate based on 2025 standard plans (e.g., annual discounts applied); always verify on sites for promotions. Tools like ElevenLabs and Speechify excel for AI-driven audiobook creation, while Descript and Auphonic shine for podcast workflows. Hindenburg makes the list (#3) as a strong audiobook specialist, though it's pricier than some AI options. For pay-per-use (e.g., Cleanvoice), I estimated moderate longform use (10-20 hours/year).

### Free and Open Source Audio Production Software

For free alternatives, open source tools provide robust options for recording, editing, TTS, and distribution without costs. 

While no single "Awesome" GitHub list covers *everything* for audiobook/podcast production, the [awesome-podcasting-tools](https://github.com/awesomelistsio/awesome-podcasting-tools) OR the [awesome-audio](https://github.com/DolbyIO/awesome-audio) repositories provide decent excellent starting point.  In the seemingly ***distant*** past, ie 2020 or so, I used to really count on these AWESOME GitHub repositories ... I thought these simple human-readable lists in MarkDown were one of the best things to come out of GitHub or crowdsourcing, but now I am not sure how well-curated these Awesome lists are any more in late 2025 ... doing this has sort of evolved, so that NOW **AI-assisted** quickie-curation of such repositories or collections of open source resources for the full pipeline (recording, hosting, analytics) is probably an activity worth doing, because the cost/pain/time of doing it is so trivial. 

What follows below is a highlighted top 10, chosen from GitHub repositories, focused on audio production ... I find that such ***top 10*** lists are useful in prompting AI to give me a quick-curated list of 100 or 200 similar/related items ... then the REAL ***fun*** begins with iterative refinement of search results and AI-assisted delving in a topic that I want to know more about ... don't worry that people like me are racking up monsterous power consumption doing this all day long ... FRANKLY, it's a lot cheaper and less resource-squandering than jumping in a vehicle, driving to a big box store like Menards or Home Depot or Lowes or all three and killing the better part of a day pushing a cart around gathering information on lumber or plumbing supplies ... and I don't have the patience, ambition, interest for doing many of these AI-assisted explorations, but the point is that, now I can do something like that and the resulting information that I get from iterative, successively-approximated querying is much better than the information that I could get 6 months or a year ago.
