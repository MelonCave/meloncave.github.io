Personal Knowledge Engineering tries to cover all things ... well, all things that a PERSON wants to know about ... but it HAS TO cover health, fitness, nutrition and exercise -- and that has to includes spiritual health ... knowledge has to START with the discipline of spiritual health. 

The strategy for exercise is not that complicated, but it's largely a matter of **discipline** ... a person must find ways to increase the amount and intensity of exercise one gets every day -- MOSTLY, this is just a matter of *just doing it* or "getting one's reps* in, but one can spice it up by trying new techniques and trends such as [*Norwegian 4x4 workout*](https://lifehacker.com/health/what-is-norwegian-4x4-workout) ... but exercise is about finding and then sticking with what works, so that one continues to develop one's discipline every day ... in theory, a person could overdo the discipline of increasing levels of exercise -- but PRACTICALLY, most people just will not CONSISTENTLY exercise enough or CONSISTENTLY with enough intensity -- almost noboby exercises too much on a CONSISTENT basis, especially not if they have a well-rounded discipline with respect to all aspects of their health ... sure, that kind of virtuous extremism might theoretically be possible -- but, CONSISTENTLY overdoing it is RARE ... even the best of the best of the best athletes, performers or operators know that they probably could exercise with greater intensity, efficacy and focus, CONSISTENTLY ensuring that each rep is optimal ... thus, the real value of exercise is not really in the physiological improvements, but rather the value is largely found as a matter of **discipline**.

Nutrition is similarly not really all THAT complicated ... but, nutrition and diet are also very much a matter of discipline and applied knowledge ... a simple, but necessary discipline to follow is to to completely AVOID the standard American diet ... AVOID sugar and anything that tastes sweet and encourages sugar cravings; avoiding things that induce cravings extends to ultra-processed and processed carbs and starches, eg breads, pastas, snacks, which are rapidly converted to glucose. The very same principle applies to easily digested news or sports or memes or any other form of entertainment/distraction that one craves and over-ingests ... ... AVOID sugar and anything that tastes sweet and encourages cravings for sweet, rapidly-digested items.  MOSTLY, dietary discipline is a matter of the cravings you AVOID ... thus, dietary discipline is not that complicated ... if you find yourself craving a dopamine hit or some form of *sweet junk*, then go without it, don't ingest it, make it more difficult to obtain, so that you won't be tempted to even think about getting a dopamine fix -- cut yourself some slack if you *fall off the wagon* but self-control is about the discipline of tapering off and driving cravings to zero.

Healthcare and healthcare insurance is slightly more complicated than the dopamine fixes from ingested entertainment or sweettooth self-control or overcoming laziness, but not really ... the best strategy is to AVOID that kind of stuff, like poison, ie treat it as one should treat sugar or anything with sugar in it. That does not mean going without health insurance or necessary visits to the emergency room or hospital, but you can't minimize dependencies on expert providers enough.

Unlike the simplicity of getting more exercise and intensity in exercise, healthcare insurance is ridiculously complicated for the trivial level of value that healthcare insurance actually provides any human ... maybe not as complicated as understanding things about health, but there's not really a substitute for that -- insurance is complicated nonetheless. If you refuse to work on understanding your health [and focus on just the finer points of healthcare insurance, rather your health, nutrition and exercise plans] then you are likely to end up in a very, very, VERY bad place healthwise ... and financially, but your money will be the least of your worries when you don't have decent levels of health and fitness. 

ANY American citizen, even poor old people, can afford to spend AT LEAST $8/day on just health/exercise ... actually, you can spend far in excess of that -- especially if you ENJOY your exercise and health optimization program ... by my estimates or or way of thinking, everyone who's 60 or over should spend at least $3000/year *on just exercise, exercise expenses and exercise equipment* -- but the important thing is that ***you have to actually do the exercise.*** 

The absolutely important thing is to avoid the whole mindset of imagining that you have to be dependent on medical/insurance/pharma as your first line of defense healthwise

The quasi-minimalist Medicare premiums [which cover medical coverage for doctors visits, in additon to hospitalization costs covered under the minimal Part A plan] are sort of trivial is about $2750/yr ... but you'll easily spend AT LEAST another $250 on transport to doctors visits, deductibles and minimal incidentals, so $3000 even if there's nothing wrong with you ... thus you should think about spending at least that kind of amount on exercising OR ELSE!

It will be a LOT more if you're sick and need the prescriptions or routine visits.

Medicare's Open Enrollment Period October 15–December 7 ... for some reason, probably the govt shutdown, Medicare currently apologizes for the inconvenience but is unable to process one's 2026 enrollment application at this time ... I don't really think about healthcare coverage that much -- in general, I try to minimize the time I waste on comparing insurance coverage because of how the process is designed to encourange one to worry about how much more insurance one needs ... my 2025 Medicare Advantage insurance plan is not available [maybe anywhere, but certainly not at this location this year] so I have to go through the enrollment process again to find a similar or close to similar plan ... I have switched from Original Medicare to a Medicare Advantage Plan only because the Advantage plan gives me back $90/month to cover half of Medicare Part B [medical coverage for doctor's visits if ever necessary] premium ... so my total cost is actually just over $1000/yr instead of $3000/yr ... and basically minimal, as long as I don't set foot in a doctor's office except in emergencies and avoid all kinds of incidental inducements to spend more than I should on extra screening and various forms of scaremongering fishing expeditions.



*Now, don't worry about the medical insurance industry or pharma industry or the constantly expanding healthcare industry* ... or maybe I should say, you don't want to think about the burden-on-society implications of people being dependent on therapists, doctors, pharma, medical insurance... the cost of being unhealthy or needing medical insurance and pharma is not just on the recipients ... the government or other taxpayers pick up at least 80% of the cost or $15000/recipient of these subsidized BASELINE minimalist insurance plan. The drain on the economy of unfit old people needing medical care is ENORMOUS ...  the drain on the economy of younger people who are generally disabled and never will be able to exercise is even worse, because younger people age and become completely dependent old people needing more care and diverting even more resources from the economy.
