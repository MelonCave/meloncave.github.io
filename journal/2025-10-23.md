Personal Knowledge Engineering tries to cover all things ... but it HAS TO cover health, fitness, nutrition and exercise. 

The strategy for exercise is not that complicated ... a person should find ways to increase the amount and intensity of exercise one gets every day ... in theory, a person could overdo the discipline of increasing levels of exercise -- but PRACTICALLY, most people do not exercise enough or with enough intensity -- almost noboby exercises too much ... sure, that kind of virtuous extremism might theoretically be possible ... it is RARE ... even the best of the best of the best athletes know that they probably could exercise with greater intensity, efficacy and focus ensuring that each rep is optimal.

Unlike the simplicity of getting more exercise and intensity in exercise, healthcare insurance is ridiculously complicated ... maybe not as complicated as understanding things about health, but there's not really a substitute for that -- insurance is complicated nonetheless. If you refuse to work on understanding your health [and focus on just the finer points of healthcare insurance, rather your health, nutrition and exercise plans] then you are likely to end up in a very, very, VERY bad place healthwise ... and financially, but your money will be the least of your worries when you don't have decent levels of health and fitness. 

ANY American citizen, even poor old people, can afford to spend AT LEAST $8/day on just health/exercise ... actually, you can spend far in excess of that -- especially if you ENJOY your exercise and health optimization program ... by my estimates or or way of thinking, everyone who's 60 or over should spend at least $3000/year *on just exercise, exercise expenses and exercise equipment* -- but the important thing is that ***you have to actually do the exercise.*** 

The absolutely important thing is to avoid the whole mindset of imagining that you have to be dependent on medical/insurance/pharma as your first line of defense healthwise

The quasi-minimalist Medicare premiums [which cover medical coverage for doctors visits, in additon to hospitalization costs covered under the minimal Part A plan] are sort of trivial is about $2750/yr ... but you'll easily spend AT LEAST another $250 on transport to doctors visits, deductibles and minimal incidentals, so $3000 even if there's nothing wrong with you ... thus you should think about spending at least that kind of amount on exercising OR ELSE!

It will be a LOT more if you're sick and need the prescriptions or routine visits.

Medicare's Open Enrollment Period October 15–December 7 ... for some reason, probably the govt shutdown, Medicare currently apologizes for the inconvenience but is unable to process one's 2026 enrollment application at this time ... I don't really think about healthcare coverage that much -- in general, I try to minimize the time I waste on comparing insurance coverage because of how the process is designed to encourange one to worry about how much more insurance one needs ... my 2025 Medicare Advantage insurance plan is not available [maybe anywhere, but certainly not at this location this year] so I have to go through the enrollment process again to find a similar or close to similar plan ... I have switched from Original Medicare to a Medicare Advantage Plan only because the Advantage plan gives me back $90/month to cover half of Medicare Part B [medical coverage for doctor's visits if ever necessary] premium ... so my total cost is actually just over $1000/yr instead of $3000/yr ... and basically minimal, as long as I don't set foot in a doctor's office except in emergencies and avoid all kinds of incidental inducements to spend more than I should on extra screening and various forms of scaremongering fishing expeditions.



*Now, don't worry about the medical insurance industry or pharma industry or the constantly expanding healthcare industry* ... or maybe I should say, you don't want to think about the burden-on-society implications of people being dependent on therapists, doctors, pharma, medical insurance... the cost of being unhealthy or needing medical insurance and pharma is not just on the recipients ... the government or other taxpayers pick up at least 80% of the cost or $15000/recipient of these subsidized BASELINE minimalist insurance plan. The drain on the economy of unfit old people needing medical care is ENORMOUS ...  the drain on the economy of younger people who are generally disabled and never will be able to exercise is even worse, because younger people age and become completely dependent old people needing more care and diverting even more resources from the economy.
