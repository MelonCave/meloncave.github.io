In information theory, the [*SURPRISAL* of information content](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-11-04.md), or revealed self-information (ie, discovered Reality vs former illusory belief), or **Shannon information** is the basic, but most necessary quantity derived from the probability of a particular event occurring from a random variable. **Shannon information** or the ***SURPRISAL of information content*** is ***what people intuitively know they MUST pay for*** ... this is not just spectators intent on watching the outcome of a game or pay-per-view sporting event, but business executives who NEED to better understand their businesses and where their business is going [or else they won't be business executives for long]. 

*The VALUE of information is its SURPRISAL and how that surprisal drives actions, which cascade and spur more re-adjustments and broader reactions to encourage sales or larger implosive/explosive market re-evaluations.* **Markets are information-additive, even multiplicative**: ***whereas news, reporters, financial journalists, news organizations, pundits and expert explainers are information destructive.***

Conceptually, Shannon information is very closely related to entropy, which is the expected value of the self-information of a random variable, quantifying ***how surprising*** that random variable is "on average". Entropy is the average amount of self-information an observer would expect to gain about a random variable when the observer is measuring that variable as accurately as possible. **Entropic intelligence, ie not just what we think we know, but ***what do we know about what we think we know***, is a very serious, extremely important matter of business.**

One example that affects users of the internet is how engagement engineers in advertising campaigns like those found in different forms of media my be thinking about **gathering marketing intelligence** ... people gathering media intelligence are going to expend a lot of resources designing in observability and tracking, not because they have the esoteric curiosity of a hacker about how a chip is performing, but because they need to measure the effectiveness of different facets of advertising. So a LOT of expense and brainpower is spent getting people to click on links, ie it's not just email spam artists and similar *evildoers* behind memes, brainrot and clickbait. SERIOUS advertising engineers are laying awake nights thinking about entropic intelligence and things like "How can we measure entropy, or a decent proxy for effectiveness in manipulating the FOMO of campaigns driving our followers' needs check status of content newsfeed and stay focused on the product, eg are live performances and *merch* freebies better at driving FOMO or should our star show up randomly in new places by dating a football player?" 

**Entropy** of information is of course also tied to the thoughts of a directors of scientific research and scientists who wonder "How far off is our model as an approximation of Reality?" and "Where should we invest resources so that we can better get at the problem of gathering entropic intelligence?"  Thus, our P.A.R.A. personal knowledgement system is really tied to the objective of re-calibration of knowledge or using information techologies to discover how bad our current knowledge is. In order to get at this problem, we want to gather insights from different realms or different categories of research or patents or similar kinds of changing technical knowledge. 

The different **Categories of our P.A.R.A. personal knowledgement system** can be thought of as **very roughly** corresponding to Ontologies in the sense that Dr. Alex Karp and the Palantirists use the word Ontology as something of a *knowledge brand* for how the Palantir approach to problems. Of course, Palantir didn't invent the word ontology and it's NOT just marketing hype for them, ie for Palantir, ***ontological thinking*** is a linguistic mindset or **the** cultural idiom which shapes how the Palantirists think, define terms, set up their machinery and basically how all problem-solving communications work for them, their customers.

Of course, an [ONTOLOGY](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/ontology/core-concepts) is at it simplest nothing more than a digital twin of a system. In a more serious sense, ontological architecture is about deep quests for knowledge, for philosophical examinations of **being**, ie *noodling* about how things are supposed to **be**, how things could **be** if constraints were removed or factors were changed, how reliably things work that actually work ***are*** working *seemingly well enough* right now. This whole realm of ***to be or not to be*** has been famously pondered for some time, even though guys like Shakespeare have only mined the topic superficially to get the nuggets of shiny things that entertain the unwashed rabble of low-brow audiences and literature critics who deconstructing the processes used to entertain and attract paying crowds. 

Ontology is traditionally understood as the subdiscipline of [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) focused on the very most general features of reality. ***Being*** encompasses all of reality and every entity within it. Remember, ***ontological thinking*** is a linguistic mindset and we care about that mindset in order to get teams, machines, systems *all on the same page* when it comes to ***articulating*** proposals and testing solutions. To ***articulate*** the basic structure of structure and of actively ***being***, ***ontological thinking*** is a matter of getting everyone, every machine involved to examine the commonalities among all things and investigates their classification into basic types, such as the [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_categories) of [particulars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular) and [universals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_(metaphysics)). 


### The Following CATEGORIES Are MINIMALLY VIABLE ... Sitting in the STAGING bin

*NOTE on the re-prioritization, sifting/sorting, re-ordering that is obviously needed. One obvious example might illustrate why ***test in-production*** must be the working principle: perhaps 29DSL should be moved from 29 to 20, to start pre-prints at 20 ... not that a little detail like that matters ... there are infinite other reorderings and re-indexing, but all reorderings are put off as we build the scaffolding we'll use to re-build a better scaffold to eventually build a better architecture, which will eventually serve as the scaffolding for a future improved architecture.*
