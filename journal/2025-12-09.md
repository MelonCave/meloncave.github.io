### Affordable and Open-Source Tech for Small-Scale Neuroarchitecture Research

Neuroarchitecture explores how built environments influence brain activity, often using EEG to measure responses like relaxation (alpha waves) or attention (beta waves) in different spaces. As a citizen researcher or hobbyist, you can contribute modestly by conducting simple experiments—e.g., recording EEG while viewing room designs or walking biophilic paths—and sharing anonymized data on platforms like OpenNeuro or GitHub. Consumer-grade brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) like Emotiv's headsets make this accessible, starting at ~$250. These devices pair with open-source software for analysis, enabling studies on topics like curved vs. angular spaces' impact on stress.

Below, I'll cover key hardware (affordable EEG devices) and software, focusing on ease of use for beginners. Prices are approximate as of December 2025; check vendors for updates.
