We continue from yesterday, working through our [Project Setup List](#project-setup-list). 

The knowledgework cognitive workflow that we are contemplating looks *something like* this: 

* First off, kicking it off with [a simplistic, uninformed SuperGrok of Project topic to kick off the iterative prompting, let's say for making sense of the latest discoveries in Biochemistry](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMi1jb3B5_b9d8ab16-80f2-4ba1-9f55-5fb171ea266a), but probably more focused, narrow as knowledge improves ... there are a lot of topics, so perhaps, done once per five weeks kind of thing thing, eg *in the first week or so in Nov we might ask about what's bubbled up since October 1 ...

* The real heavy lifting is actually done in the *thinkering* that results from the iterative prompting, by swimming or *trying to swim* in the knowledge, reviewing the full Ishikawa of results ... [using rounds of Gemini AI for deeper iterative questioning and probing](https://share.google/aimode/COM6VAAjDHwC1nkNn) ... taking notes, adding details, possibly along with NotebookLLM for audio explanation to recap and review the whole context of what was covered later. ***Thinkering*** means putting the knowledge into practice, testing one's understanding, producing reproducible results with different inputs ... **thinkering** has to be HARD, knuckle-skinning tinkering of mechanically stepping through a thought process, involving the frustration, helplessness and failure of not getting it right at first OR, else, it's not really *thinkering*.

* The *holy grail* is something like [emergent neuromorphology or sparking something embryonic morphogenesis](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMi1jb3B5_08973e84-67af-4db9-a382-2292404a8b74) in complex organisms like humans ... which starts with cells migrate via gradients; then adhesion sorts types and shapes organs such that incredibly complex physiological lifeforms elegantly emerges from relatively simple cues.

**The POINT of doing these kinds of [daily] PKM exercises is for programming ourselves, re-wiring our brains ... and, MAYBE, for developing or stumbling on to the foundations of the next, maybe smarter, phase of our PKE system.**

We should stop and refocus by reminding ourselves ***why we bother doing this or what we are doing with PKM.*** *PKM is really about ***immersion*** and note-taking as we explore different ways of thinking ... ULTIMATELY, we be able to *speak and ***think*** like a native* when we approach advanced research or knowledge engineering ... now, we're just trying to explore and take notes.

Knowledge engineering at this point in time is akin to how EARLY compute was mechanical, like an adding machine, then more complex [Monroe calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Systems_for_Business) or [IBM tabulators with punched cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_record_equipment), when then evolved into being something like an [analog electronic calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vincent_Atanasoff#Computer_development) for large volumes of number crunching ... but then quickly became THEN more programmable, with algorithmic data processing and technicians/programmers trained to program the logic of the machine.

As we think about this, we have to try to get our heads wrapped around **FUTURE** problem-solving processes in knowledge engineering, ie what comes **after** the algorithm, after we use the tedious skill of programming. We don't really even yet have a vocabulary yet for describing the continents, mountain ranges and vast terrain of knowledgework that comes AFTER the [Bush's memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think), AFTER [Admiral Hopper's linkers, compilers and algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) ... the cognitive human work***flow*** that comes AFTER the [algorithmic FLOW-MATIC paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC).

**WHAT COMES AFTER THIS is DEFINITELY NOT ABOUT MEMORIZING TEDIOUS FACTOIDS or AI pet tricks or ridiculously tedious AI benchmarks like [Humanity's **Last** Exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanity%27s_Last_Exam)!** *What comes next is about immersive meta-language, thinking in concepts and expressing ideas, synthesizing creative ideas from millions of different realms and developing strategies that will be used in/across different fields of research.*  

As we learned about data, then tables of data and the explosion of data and data processing ... part of it is about distillation and simplification into patterns and ordinary little pattern-based thoughtchunk building blocks, ie utilities like [grep](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html) or [the Unix programming environment](https://archive.org/details/unixprogramminge0000kern/page/102/mode/2up) ... *the Reality of contemplating this kind of work is more than humbling!* 

The more knowledge that humans put to use, the more they will realize how much MORE knowledge they still have to acquire and put to use, ie it's like some wonk or whiz kid, eg a Robert McNamara or RAND corp figure in the 40s, 50s or 60s realizing that, now that everyone can process a lot more data, everyone is going to be scrambling to fill the need for a heckuva lot more DATA ... the resulting rapid release of huge amounts of light, heat, and sound delivers a seemingly all-consuming *explosion* ... which will be the same for knowledge engineering, ie the 10X-per-5-years growth in information processing will continue -- the majority might imagine that it's unsustainable, but it's basically just that change happens and that the lives/work of parents changes dramatically from one generation to the next [as long as there are now wars or events that set everyone back to *square one*], such that grandparents/grandchildren cannot **really** understand the concerns/struggles/lives of their grandchildren/grandparents.
