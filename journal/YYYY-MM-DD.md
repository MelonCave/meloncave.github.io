Foam formating is for VS Code only ... MarkDown notes created with Foam will not work correctly with web browser viewing a GitHub repo.

Use **ALT+D** or **ALT+H** to open new Journal file ... reference former files with [[wiki-links]] or journal entries, eg [[2025-09-09]], but always use [[foam-file-format]] to keep notetaking *atomic.*

Access more Foam commands with **CTRL+SHIFT+P** ***Foam Command**... for example, **CTRL+SHIFT+P Foam Show**

Remember to use foam jargon or [[terminology]] when exploring [[recipes]] for [[creating-new-notes]] for proper [[graph-visualisation]].
