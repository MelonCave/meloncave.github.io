We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-10-05.md) to build out Projects, completely RETHINKING P.A.R.A. structured PKE workflows ... by continuing [[2015-10-09]] yesteday's examination of the [**nomadic portfolio lifestyle**, including side-hustles, the gig economy, startups and co-founders, awareness of the funding and acquhire issues as well as navigation of the project talent aquistion landscape](https://ancientguy.github.io/PKM/2.Areas/12PortfolioLifestyle.html). 

Again we might ask, what does this mean for the operation PKM/PKE system? What would be some of the key features of this PKM/PKE system? How might it be different from a more traditional P.A.R.A. structured system ... how might it be the same? Since the SYSTEM is a time management and **productivity** system, what would a daily workflow of a user, particularly for one focused on a nomadic portfolio lifestyle look like?

### Achieving Underconfidence Through Expertise

### Achieving Underconfidence Through Expertise

Expertise must be PRACTICAL. It's not possible to just throw $ at every intersting experiment. It's necessary to think about low- or no-cost ways of obtaining, renting, *stealing*, borrowing, *cheap-assedly* trying out the minimal materials to build MVP prototypes ofthe tech ... not just reading about or asking AI for backgrounders, but hands-on awareness to understand the lay of the land; getting the most timely and optimal comparables for where things WILL BE GOING ... it's not about following the crowd or believing the conventional wisdom, ie regurg'd PR releases ... understanding the lay of the land and having situational awareness about the ongoing battle has to be focused on anticipating where the crowd is going to be going.

UNDERSTANDING is mostly about understand the validity of the concerns about how the hyped tech fails -- this is key to understanding the REAL, LASTING validity of the tested, battered positives driving the adoption of the tech  ... so we're not talking about 1st mover advantage or even past 2nd mover or 3rd mover advantage ... we're really talking about having a detailed, skinned-knuckle-level hands-on ***understanding*** of the hype cycle and working with tech, not just reading or following the news.

It is necessary to get past the Dunning-Kruger effect that arises from consuming the propaganda spewing from the hype machines ... since REAL expertise necessarily leads to underconfidence, the canary in the coalmine is reaching the point of underconfidence where one wants to give up.  Without achieving this level off underconfidence, it's impossible to legitimately claim sufficient expertise ... so it's important to implement the tech, drink from the impossible firehose of technial research and reach the point where one is overwhelmed with all of the opportunities for how the whole cheap sweater unravels and fails ... to go **beyond** reading the conventional wisdom on OpenAI, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, A2I and maybe blogs/pods like Latent.Space and knowing just enough to be dangerous, ie imagining that one understands and believes in the AI landscape ... expertise is about reaching the point of disbelief, despair, disgust ... AND to push beyond that sorry state to get to the *Aha!* moment of **understanding the really solid parts of what might just work.**

There are cognitive **reasons** for expert underconfidence ... what this amounts to is kind of a checklist of fears that that one really needs to encounter, BEFORE imagining that one is sufficiently competent to be confident of one's expertise:

* Knowledge as a vaccination: When you become an expert, it's hard to imagine what it was like before having the sufficient knowledge, but this inevitably leads to assuming that others, of course, must have a similar level of understanding, causing you to undervalue or **appropriately value your own insights**.

* Awareness of complexity: The more you learn, the more you realize the vastness of your field and **how many nuances still exist**. An expert's greater metacognition (thinking about thinking) means they have a more realistic view of their abilities compared to others, but this will lead them to underestimate their own relative superiority.
    
* Emphasis on exceptions: **Legitimate experts are mentally disciplined to focus on subtle distinctions; not esoterica, but pivotally important exceptions to rules**, rather than the broad, simple principles *which EVERYBODY already knows*. This habit of looking for what they don't know causes the true experts to become less confident in their overall knowledge.

* Overestimation of others [who are shrewd enough to operate in stealth mode]: While they have a more realistic view of their own knowledge, **real experts must overestimate the knowledge and skill of hidden expertise**, especially those who they do not know about. Experts have to assume that tasks are simple for everyone because those things are straightforward for them, leading them to correctly undervalue their own abilities relative to what might be out there in others who are hidden.
