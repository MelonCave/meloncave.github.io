We [***continue***](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal/2025-10-05.md) to build out Projects, completely RETHINKING P.A.R.A. structured PKE workflows ... by continuing [[2015-10-09]] yesteday's examination of the [**nomadic portfolio lifestyle**, including side-hustles, the gig economy, startups and co-founders, awareness of the funding and acquhire issues as well as navigation of the project talent aquistion landscape](https://ancientguy.github.io/PKM/2.Areas/12PortfolioLifestyle.html). 

Again we might ask, what does this mean for the operation PKM/PKE system? What would be some of the key features of this PKM/PKE system? How might it be different from a more traditional P.A.R.A. structured system ... how might it be the same? Since the SYSTEM is a time management and **productivity** system, what would a daily workflow of a user, particularly for one focused on a nomadic portfolio lifestyle look like? 

Getting the materials to build the tech ... not reading about but hands-on awareness to understand the lay of the land; getting the most timely and optimal comparables for where things WILL BE GOING ... it's not about following the crowd or believing the conventional wisdom, ie regurg'd PR releases ... understanding the lay of the land and having situational awareness about the ongoing battle has to be focused on anticipating where the crowd is going to be going.

UNDERSTANDING is mostly about understand the validity of the hype and the validity of the concerns ... so we're not talking about 1st mover advantage or even past 2nd mover or 3rd mover advantage ... we're really talking about having a hands-on ***understanding*** of the hype cycle and working with tech, not just reading or following the news, to get past the Dunning-Kruger effect that arises from consuming the propaganda spewing from the hype machines ... since expertise leads to underconfidence, the canary in the coalmine is underconfidence -- without achieving underconfidence, it's impossible to legitimately claim sufficient expertise ... it's important to implement the tech, read technial research and reach the point where one is overwhelmed with all of the opportunities for how the whole cheap sweater unravels and fails ... to go **beyond** reading the conventional wisdom on OpenAI, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, A2I and maybe blogs/pods like Latent.Space and knowing just enough to be dangerous, ie imagining that one understands and believes in the AI landscape ... expertise is about reaching the point of disbelief, despair, disgust AND pushing beyond that to get to that point of **understanding what might just work.**

There are cognitive **reasons** for expert underconfidence ... what this amounts to is kind of a checklist of fears that that one really needs to encounter, BEFORE imagining that one is sufficiently competent to be confident of one's expertise:

* Knowledge as a vaccination: When you become an expert, it's hard to imagine what it was like before having the sufficient knowledge, but this inevitably leads to assuming that others, of course, must have a similar level of understanding, causing you to undervalue or **appropriately value your own insights**.

* Awareness of complexity: The more you learn, the more you realize the vastness of your field and **how many nuances still exist**. An expert's greater metacognition (thinking about thinking) means they have a more realistic view of their abilities compared to others, but this will lead them to underestimate their own relative superiority.
    
* Emphasis on exceptions: Experts are often trained to focus on subtle distinctions and exceptions to rules, rather than the broad, simple principles *which EVERYBODY already knows*. This habit of looking for what they don't know causes the true experts to become less confident in their overall knowledge.

* Overestimation of others [who are shrewd enough to operate in stealth mode]: While they have a more realistic view of their own knowledge, experts tend to overestimate the knowledge and skill of hidden expertise, especially those who they don't know about. They might assume that a task is simple for everyone because it is simple for them, leading them to undervalue their own abilities relative to others.
