# About

The Salebarn project is about accelerating and improving the execution of those recurrent tasks that are associated with selling something or developing new business.

Salebarn is NOT a replacement for eBay or Amazon or Etsy Ritchie Bros or Sotheby's or any auctioneer that operates either online or physical auctions.

Salebarn is NOT a replacement for Salesforce or Hubspot or Marketo or any other service that helps you to manage relationships with customers or important business partners.

Salebarn is OPEN SOURCE technology that essentially provides a meta-SaaS or meta software-as-a-service, ie an open source driven software-as-a-service of services.  

Thus, the Salebarn project is largely what YOU make it.
