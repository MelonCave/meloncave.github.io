# CAVE in the MELON of your demonic bad habits

You know what you're doing wrong ... STOP IT ... and for pete's sake, STOP trying to fix me ... FIX YOURSELF

1) FIX your spiritual life ... STOP worshipping celebrities ... STOP playing church ... AVOID politicos

2) STOP eating stupid shit ... STOP ever buying stupid shit ... start growing your own food

3) Get rid of your addictions ... special occasions are one thing, but get rid of ANY regular use of alcohol

4) Exercise and train in the martial arts for 4-8 hrs per day, EVERY DAY ... change up your routine, but get a routine

5) NEVER put important stuff off ... ALWAYS put off un-important stuff until you can't think of anything else to do

6) NEVER give in to needing routine prescription medications ... get to root cause ... stop relying on doctors -- develop awareness of your own health, body, fitness

7) NEVER buy anything out of fear or worry or superstition ... Ya Ain't Gonna Need That Shit ... avoid ALL insurance purchases, except for the liability coverage required by law.

8) Use meditation rather than painkillers to deal with pain ... UNDERSTAND your pain rather than running from it.

9) Stop enabling addicts, time wasters and people who need or want friends to engage in bad habits with them

10) NEVER EVER LOOK IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR ... let the dead bury their dead ... kill off all of the zombie processes and intiators of zombie processes.
