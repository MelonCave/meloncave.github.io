# STOP the bad habits of being yourself

REWIRE your brain ... cave in the melon of that passive moron who's become a product of his demons ... tell your demons to go back to HELL.

You know what you're doing wrong, so it's simple ... just STOP IT ... STOP IT. 

For pete's sake, STOP trying to fix anyone else ... FIX YOURSELF FIRST

When people see you have no problems, MAYBE they will come ask you for help ... and maybe they won't, because PASSIVE VICTIMS tend to HATE success.  PASSIVE victims tend to BLAME others who have stop the bad habits of being themselves.

When people are are actually serious about overhauling their lives ... then the melons of their demons have been caved in and there is hope.

# Melon Cave is an ANTI-media media

**Stop apologizing for perfecting your soul** ... stop following celebrities ... stop playing church or longing for a great performance from the pulpit. **Perfect your soul.**

1) FIX your spiritual life ... STOP worshipping celebrities ... STOP playing church; sermons are for zombies ... take back your prayer life; keep a prayer journal; BE the LIFE that defines your own media.

2) STOP eating stupid shit ... STOP ever buying stupid shit ... start growing your own food

3) Get rid of your addictions ... special occasions are one thing, but get rid of ANY regular use of alcohol

4) Exercise and train in the martial arts for 4-8 hrs per day, EVERY DAY ... change up your routine, but get a routine

5) NEVER put important stuff off ... ALWAYS put off un-important stuff until you can't think of anything else to do

6) NEVER give in to needing routine prescription medications ... get to root cause ... stop relying on doctors -- develop awareness of your own health, body, fitness

7) NEVER buy anything out of fear or worry or superstition ... Ya Ain't Gonna Need That Shit ... avoid ALL insurance purchases, except for the liability coverage required by law.

8) Use meditation rather than painkillers to deal with pain ... UNDERSTAND your pain rather than running from it.

9) Stop enabling addicts, time wasters and people who need or want friends to engage in bad habits with them

10) NEVER EVER LOOK IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR ... let the dead bury their dead ... kill off all of the zombie processes and intiators of zombie processes.
