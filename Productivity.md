# Productivity

Stop EVER passively consuming content ... NEVER watch videos when you can read or work through learning exercises in a hands-on fashion.

If you imagine that you need to watch a movie or sports or news ... turn off all the lights, get down on your knees and PRAY ... then meditate and practice focusing on imroving your ability to focus ... until you are ready to act like a RESPONSIBLE adult, rather than an old overgrown, spoiled child that needs to be ABANDONED in front a teevee to be babysat.

Here is a draft syllabus for a 200 module graduate/postgraduate level course on improving one's reading skills and strategies:

1. Foundations of Effective Reading

   - Importance of reading for personal and professional development
   - Types of reading (skimming, scanning, in-depth, etc.)
   - Setting reading goals and creating a personalized reading plan
   - Overcoming common reading challenges (lack of time, motivation, etc.)

2. Neuroscience of Reading

   - Neural circuits involved in reading (visual word form area, etc.)
   - Eye movements and saccades during reading
   - Role of attention, working memory, and executive functions
   - Neuroplasticity and training the brain for better reading
   - Neuromyths about reading (e.g., left-brain vs. right-brain reading)

3. Speed Reading Techniques

   - History and science of speed reading
   - Techniques for increasing reading speed (chunking, reducing subvocalization, etc.)
   - Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) and its effectiveness
   - Software and apps for speed reading training
   - Balancing speed with comprehension and retention

4. Effective Comprehension Strategies

   - Active reading techniques (questioning, summarizing, predicting, etc.)
   - Metacognitive strategies for monitoring understanding
   - Identifying main ideas, key details, and organizational patterns
   - Graphic organizers and mind mapping for visual comprehension
   - Techniques for reading complex texts (academic journals, technical manuals, etc.)

5. Utilizing Abstracts and Summaries

   - Purpose and structure of abstracts and executive summaries
   - Strategies for quickly gleaning key information from abstracts
   - Using abstracts to determine relevance and priority of reading materials
   - Writing effective abstracts and summaries for personal use
   - Limitations of relying solely on abstracts

6. Memory Techniques for Reading

   - Encoding strategies for better retention (elaboration, visualization, etc.)
   - Mnemonic devices for remembering key information (acronyms, memory palaces, etc.)
   - Spaced repetition and review for long-term retention
   - Teaching others as a way to reinforce learning from reading
   - Overcoming the forgetting curve and improving recall

7. Harnessing Technology for Reading

   - Using e-readers, tablets, and reading apps effectively
   - Text-to-speech and audiobook strategies
   - Online course platforms and MOOCs for structured reading
   - Social reading platforms and online book clubs
   - Assistive technologies for reading disabilities

8. Leveraging AI for Reading

   - Using AI-powered summarization tools (e.g., GPT-3)
   - AI-based recommendation systems for discovering new reads
   - Chatbots and virtual study partners for discussing reading material
   - AI-assisted speed reading and comprehension training
   - Ethical considerations and limitations of AI in reading

9. Cognitive and Behavioral Strategies for Better Reading

   - Pomodoro technique and time management for reading sessions
   - Habit formation and tracking for consistent reading practice
   - Reducing distractions and creating an optimal reading environment
   - Overcoming procrastination and reader's block
   - Stress management and mindfulness techniques for focused reading

10. Capstone Project / Practicum

    - Students design and implement a personalized reading improvement plan
    - Regular progress tracking and reflection through reading journals
    - Demonstrating measurable improvements in reading speed, comprehension, and volume
    - Potential for small group reading circles and peer feedback
    - Final presentation or paper showcasing insights and growth from the course
