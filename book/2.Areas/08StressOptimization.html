<p>The stress management section explores one's evolving relationship with stress while examining physiological, psychological, and relational dimensions of the stress response. Questions address mindfulness practices, present-moment awareness, and environmental factors that influence baseline stress levels. The section covers physical approaches to stress reduction, time management strategies, and prioritization methods that prevent unnecessary stressors. Special attention is given to developing long-term stress resilience, reframing past stressful experiences as sources of wisdom, and approaching stress management as a spiritual discipline. The questions encourage cultivating perspective, gratitude, and peace in challenging circumstances while honoring God's gift of peace amidst life's difficulties.</p>
