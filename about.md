Salebarn, LLC is a trading and investment company with a market technology R&D lab.  Markets that are more free and open allocate resources better for the benefit of everyone.  Since markets are never perfectly free, but are constrained by governments, Salebarn's R&D is focused on technologies that can transcend governments.  For example, Salebarn accelerated negotiation technologies are for the construction of decentralized exchanges and marketplaces built upon smart contracts, replicated, decentralized databases and encrypted protocol messaging systems similar to blockchain databases and bitcoin protocol. 

DISCLAIMER: Any technological implementation will necessarily involve flaws in code, imperfection in execution and all kinds of unintended or unforeseen consequences. Therefore, the objective of these open source market technologies can never be perfection [according to anyone's definition of what perfection is].  The attainable objective is the provision of extensible code repositories and methodologies for implementing safe, secure mechanisms of exchange that are better for achieving their objectives than competing alternatives.
