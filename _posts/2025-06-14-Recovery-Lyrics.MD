# The Road to Recovery Based on the Beatitudes

## 1. "Empty Pockets, Empty Soul"
*Realization of Powerlessness*

man, i used to think i was the cat's pajamas  
the big cheese, the whole enchilada  
walking through this concrete jungle  
like i owned every broken streetlight  
every cigarette butt crushed under heel  

but dig this, daddy-o—  
the mirror don't lie when the lights come up  
and all my smooth moves  
all my hip jive talk  
couldn't keep me from falling  
couldn't keep the world from spinning  
out of my sweaty, trembling hands  

i'm just a man, jack  
poor in spirit, rich in need  
standing here with empty pockets  
and an empty soul  
finally ready to admit  
i ain't the one running this show  

the kingdom of heaven, they say  
belongs to cats like me—  
broke down, busted up  
powerless as a saxophone  
without breath to make it sing  

## 2. "Believing in Divine Comfort"
*Mourning Coffee*

three a.m. and the coffee's cold  
like the tears i never let fall  
until now, baby, until now  

been carrying this weight  
this blue note sadness  
like a bass line that won't quit  
thrumming through my chest  
keeping time with a broken heart  

but somewhere in the static  
of this late-night radio station  
i hear it—a whisper, a promise  
that God sees these salt-water prayers  
these midnight confessions  
to an empty diner booth  

he matters, this cosmic cat  
this divine daddy-o  
and somehow, impossibly  
i matter to him too  

mourning becomes morning  
when you realize someone's listening  
someone's got the power  
to turn your blue notes  
into something beautiful  

comfort comes like dawn  
slow and sure  
painting the world  
in colors you forgot existed  

## 3. "Surrendering the Wheel"
*Choosing Divine Control*

been driving this jalopy life  
with broken brakes and no headlights  
thinking i knew the way  
through these twisted streets  
these dead-end dreams  

but meek ain't weak, jack  
meek is knowing when to pull over  
when to slide across the bench seat  
and let someone else take the wheel  

Christ, they call him  
this cosmic chauffeur  
who knows every pothole  
every shortcut through the pain  
every scenic route to grace  

i'm consciously choosing now  
to be passenger in my own story  
hands folded, eyes open  
watching the landscape change  
as we cruise toward something  
bigger than my small-time schemes  

the earth belongs to those  
who know they don't own it  
who can ride shotgun  
with the divine  
and dig the journey  

control is just another word  
for the fear of letting go  
but letting go, baby  
that's where the real living starts  

## 4. "Truth Serum Blues"
*Honest Self-Examination*

step right up to the mirror, mac  
time for some truth serum  
straight, no chaser  
the kind that burns going down  
but clears your vision after  

been hiding behind dark glasses  
and darker secrets  
hurts stacked up like old newspapers  
habits hanging like smoke  
in a closed room  

but pure in heart means  
no more masquerade  
no more shadow dancing  
around the real deal  
the naked truth of who i am  

confessing to myself first  
then to God  
then to that one cat  
who won't run when the music stops  
and the lights come up  

examination ain't persecution  
it's excavation  
digging through the rubble  
of who i thought i was  
to find who i really am  

and they promise—these wise cats—  
that pure hearts see God  
not in some far-off heaven  
but right here, right now  
in the honesty of the moment  

truth is the only drug  
that leads to real freedom  

## 5. "Hungry Ghost Transformation"
*Submitting to Divine Change*

i've been a hungry ghost, daddy  
wandering through life  
with an appetite  
nothing could satisfy  
thirsting for something  
i couldn't name  

but righteousness—  
now there's a word  
that tastes different  
when you're ready to be filled  

voluntarily, they say  
like volunteering for surgery  
letting the divine surgeon  
cut away the infected parts  
the character defects  
that keep me sick  

hungering and thirsting  
not for the next fix  
the next thrill  
the next escape  
but for right-ness  
for alignment  
for the sweet spot  
where God's will and mine  
make beautiful music together  

humbly asking  
remove these thorns  
these patterns  
these ways of being  
that keep me small  
keep me broken  
keep me running  

transformation is submission  
submission is freedom  
freedom is finally  
being filled  

## 6. "Mercy Street Meditation"
*Forgiveness and Amends*

mercy street runs both ways, jack  
and i've been living  
on the corner of resentment  
and revenge  
for way too long  

time to evaluate  
these tangled relationships  
these debts of the heart  
these IOUs written in tears  

forgiveness ain't for them—  
it's for me  
cutting the chains  
that keep me chained  
to yesterday's wounds  

making amends  
when it won't cause more harm  
stepping up to the microphone  
of accountability  
singing the song of sorrow  
and the blues of being better  

peacemaking is an art form  
requires the same skill  
as improvisation—  
listening, responding  
creating harmony  
out of discord  

mercy shown  
mercy received  
the cosmic circle  
keeps spinning  
and for once  
i'm dancing  
instead of fighting  
the rhythm  

children of God—  
that's what they call  
the cats who make peace  
not war  

## 7. "Daily Bread, Daily Prayer"
*Spiritual Discipline*

every morning now  
i reserve this time  
like a table for two  
at the cosmic café  

self-examination  
over black coffee  
scripture like morning news  
from headquarters upstairs  
prayer like conversation  
with the coolest cat  
in the universe  

not some religious ritual  
but relationship, baby  
getting to know  
the divine daddy-o  
learning his frequency  
tuning in to his wavelength  

daily bread means  
more than food for the body  
it's nourishment for the soul  
strength for the journey  
power to follow through  
on this wild, holy will  

consistency is key  
like practicing scales  
until the music flows  
naturally, effortlessly  
from fingers to keys  
from heart to heaven  

this daily discipline  
keeps me plugged in  
to the source  
the power  
the love  
that keeps me clean  
keeps me free  
keeps me real  

## 8. "Gospel According to the Street"
*Sharing the Message*

persecution comes with the territory  
when you're living righteous  
in an unrighteous world  
but the kingdom of heaven  
belongs to cats like us  
who ain't afraid  
to tell the truth  

yielding myself now  
like a musician yields  
to the song  
letting God use  
these hands  
this voice  
this story  
to bring good news  
to the broken-hearted  
the strung-out  
the lost  

example speaks louder  
than the sweetest sermon  
and words without lifestyle  
are just noise  
just empty jive  

but when they see  
how the divine  
changed this wreck  
into something beautiful  
when they hear  
the music of recovery  
in my voice  
my walk  
my way of being  

that's when the good news  
becomes gospel  
becomes hope  
becomes the bridge  
over troubled water  

persecution for righteousness  
just means  
you're doing something right  
living something real  
being something authentic  
in a world full  
of beautiful counterfeits  

the kingdom of heaven  
is right here, right now  
in the midst  
of broken people  
making each other whole
