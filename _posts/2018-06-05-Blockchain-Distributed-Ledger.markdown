The conventional wisdom about bitcoin and blockchain is that this approach to distributed currency solved the problem of distributed consensus in a trustless network using using public key cryptography with an energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism to provide a secure, controlled, and decentralized method of minting digital currency ... but this is hardly elegant a solution, certainly nowhere near as useful as refining ore containing the metal into gold that is actually USEFUL for something ... and besides being pretty to look at and weigthty, gold is also an extremely USEFUL metal ... is bitcoin useful in the same way that gold is?  Clearly not.  

It is NOT that bitcoin is digital information, easily transported around the world ... we know that digital information in a coherent form can be EXTREMELY useful ... so much of the power of bitcoin is in its way of tracking ARTIFICIAL scarcity.  When it comes right down to it, artificial scarcity is really not all that revolutionary.
