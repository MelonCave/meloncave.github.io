*This is ONLY boilerplate text for a reading list ... we are working on developing a better template for our curated, annotated reading lists.*


{{{TOC}}}

## Introduction

This reading list is about value, choice, prices, markets, auctions, trading exchanges, information and capital.

You might imagine that you have a pretty good idea of what **value** is, as long as you actually bother to spend some time actually THINKING deeply about what is valuable to you. Most people REFUSE to do this; it makes them a bit uncomfortable -- they prefer to dwell upon what others value, what is currently fashionable or how fashions are changing. The biggest truth of economics is that whatever is truly, intrinsically, deeply valuable to you has absolutely NOTHING whatsoever to do with what is valuable to another person. And vice versa. People might imagaine that value the same things as others, eg a person might value being warm in the Winter or cool in the Summer, but exact degree to which any person values their choice of ideal temperatures settings or the flucuation in temperature over the day or year or lifetime is very, VERY, **VERY** different for each one of us. For more billions different reasons than there are billions of humans.

Perceptions, judgements, valuations of **choice** vary immensely ... by the moment ... even in something as mundane and ordinary as the temperature or the comfort settings of our immediate environment.  Of course, physiologically, all of those 9 billion value-ers are basically all the same members of the same species, ie they could have their temperatures managed as if they were livestock [or in prison] but they would lose something intrinsically valuable by having their *temperature* or *ambient comfort* choice taken from them.  Each individual will ***value*** some attribute of some thing, like the air in their immediate environment, differently ... valuation is UNIQUE. Your ***values*** or valuations completely define your life -- although those values shift not just over your life, but from year to year, from day to day and even from second to second. It's almost ridiculous to talk about **shared** values in the inherently ephemeral environment of the human mind ... values are HELD, opinions can be shared, values cannot be shared -- they must be *arrived at* on personal level ... that's why taking **choice** away from human beings is why fights break out, people choose sides and wars and massive killing gets underway. NEVER advocate taking choice away from human beings unless you want to initiate a war.
 

**Why did we start curating this reading list?**

Roughly 2000ish ... or maybe slightly before, ie your mileage may vary ... the world changing ***more*** rapidly than it had changed before.

It was primarily cultural, but driven the affordability of information technology that was actually useful, even mission-critical for many enterprise billions could level-up develop their communication skillset ... they could accelerate the productivity of how they managed their human-to-human networks.  Yes, it was possible to fritter away time with memes and porn ... but after 2000ish or slightly before, people had email addresses and then around 2010 or maybe slightly before, people started really using Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn to stay in touch [without having to physically do Thanksgiving or attend professional conferences] ... affordability of productive technology mattered, not because of technology or apps, but because of the PEOPLE that mattered.

Then, in level of change accelerated roughly around 2020, ie coincident with the global worries and restrictions over covid ... at first, it was ***just*** Zoom making things like work, funerals or *important* meetings or conferences possible ... but, MORE IMPORTANTLY, billions of PEOPLE learned that ALMOST **ALL** routine expense/effort such as like commuting to a physical workplace, going to funerals or concerts or or college football tailgates or other *cant-miss* events, flying to *urgent* business meetings and *important* professional conferences was actually entirely **OPTIONAL**.

The Earth didn't stop spinning and, for almost all, ***life went on*** ... without the entirely **OPTIONAL** routine, formerly unquestioned expense/effort.

## Meaningful content with Google Analytics became necessary in the 2000s ... after 2020 that content needs YOUR analytics dashboard and the content must be responsive, subtly providing YOUR business's recommenders, ie not Google Ads.

First, in the 2000s was Google Analytics ... then, in the 2010s, prospecting really changed [Dharmesh Shah](https://network.hubspot.com/profile/dharmesh)'s [The Hubspot Culture Code](https://network.hubspot.com/slides/the-hubspot-culture-code) explained how/why inbound marketing works ... and how/why constant contact email spam just pisses people off ... others like Salesforce understand how to **really** *USE* customer relationship management and business development ***SYSTEMS*** to stay in touch with customers in a way that customers actually value, ie not the annoying email spam that has to be *unsubscribed* every day. 

Lately, we have seen a gigantic shift toward *shiny* things [which someone thinks are cute] like chatbots and **somewhat** *intelligent* recommender systems ... but frankly, much of the *early* adoption of AI/ML has been painfully, brutually ***ANNOYING*** ... and so annoying that people stopped paying attention AT ALL -- early AI/ML *has been* much like the blinking, flourescent rainbow text of the 90 interwebs, ie fortunately, the AI/ML so far has not quite been bad enough to completely drive ALL people away ... but AI/ML has not ***YET*** *turned the corner* of utilitarian usefulness like email or virtual conferencing. 

AI/ML for accelerating business development will turn that corner ... out of necessity. Enterprise depends upon outreach and NEW customers ... it used to [and still does] depend upon the stall in the bazaar or farmer's market and then auction event or salebarn to develop a reputation, make connections and set a price for premium quality produce ... then outreach became a matter of a bricks and mortar location or a shopping venue which people valued strictly for the experience of shopping -- then online shopping venues established themselves by offering an embarrassingly massive selection of comparable items to shoppers who valued comparison [and sometimes price] over the experience of physical shopping.  

We have not yet seen AI/ML offer RADICALLY compelling reason for customers, shoppers, earnest able-to-pay bidders, appraisers or sellers ... in the manner that Amazon or PayPal / eBay offered RADICALLY more comparison in a massively global sense to their audience of monetizable users ... people are trying lots of things, but it's not yet clear that any of the mud being thrown at the wall is actually *sticking* ... someone's mud will stick and that enterprise will be the next Amazon or PayPal/eBay. 

## The market for talent has changed

Perhaps by the day ... or hour ... and through the rise of subscription-based content-providing professionals ... it takes an enormous amount of time ... but, slowly humans are becoming more independent in how they work, how they spend their hourly lives ... *slowly*, slowly, SLOWLY we are seeing the demise of slavery, that includes the ***wage*** slavery of typical worklives.

This is all about the listing that companies post ... we are probably not actually going to apply for these positions, but these posted positions do give an indication of what kinds of skills were important when the positions were posted ... things change rapidly, but other than talking directly with companies who need services (ie what inbound marketing is about), there's probably not a better way to find out where the needs for talent/skills is the hottest.
