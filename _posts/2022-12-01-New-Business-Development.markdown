If you want to understand economics more rapidly ... you really need to slow down and READ ... not just read, but ***read a lot more*** ... you do not want to waste ANY time taking in the news or reading the current headlines ... you want to READ things that are timeless.

Economics and the topics that humans concern themselves with are exactly the kinds of things that humans have been writing about for as long as people have been writing things for others to read.

It's not just the *Classics* ... or material that has become recognized and defined as *Classic* because the writing speaks to some sort of deeper, more lasting, more profound human truth ... essentially, at its core, economics is about the kinds of practical ideas and choices that re-occur throughout the ages and will always preoccupied human thinkers and visionaries ... as these topics have done for five thousand years and probably more.

These topics are important enough that you probably will want to curate and annotate your own reading lists ... the following reading list *EXAMPLES* are about **value, choice, prices, markets, auctions, trading exchanges, information, capital, technology, data, AI/ML, human capital, skills, talent** and, of course, **slavery, liberty, freedom and DISCIPLINE**.

### Why curate reading lists?

You curate reading lists for the same reason that you read, in order to help yourself THINK, think more deeply, to revisit what you have read after a period of letting your thoughts go cold ... so that you can more deeply explore what you have read and thought ... and to maybe get yourself back on track when you are questioning your thinking. 

***You curate reading lists in order to escape the prison of Time and have a more meaningful conversation with your own mind.***

Time plays cruel tricks on us ... our daily lives are ***imprisoned*** by Time, but our thoughts do not need to be held by the *time prison.*  Perhaps an example can illustrate.  As you may recall, around roughly 2000ish ... or maybe slightly before, ie your mileage may vary ... the world changing ***more*** rapidly than it had changed before.

The change that mattered was primarily a cultural phenomenom, driven the affordability of increasingly powerful information technology that actually proved to be quite useful, even mission-critical for many enterprise billions could level-up develop their communication skillset. As humans upped their game in the mastery of information technology, they found that they not only could accelerate the on-the-job productivity but maybe what mattered more was in how they manage their human-to-human networks. Yes, it was certainly possible to fritter away time with memes and porn ... but life has always offered way too many distractions to the newly affluent ... after 2000ish or slightly before, people had email addresses and their friends had email addresses and maybe webpages or then things like *walls* on Facebook or other social media presences. 

Then around 2010 or maybe slightly before ... the same thing happened that had happened with the critical mass of email ... because their friends, college buddies, professional colleagues were also using the stuff, people started really using Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn to better stay in touch *without having to* ***physically*** attend class reunions, uncomfortable extended family gatherings or stuffy professional conferences ... the affordability of ***productive*** technology mattered, but not because of the technologies or applications themselves, but it was because of the critical mass of PEOPLE using the **communication** channel which actually mattered.

Then, in pace of change accelerated or hit something of an inflection point, roughly around 2020, ie coincident with the global worries and restrictions over covid ... at first, it was ***just*** Zoom making things like work, funerals or *important* meetings or conferences even possible ... so that modern life could go on. MORE IMPORTANTLY, as a result of this shared experience, billions of PEOPLE learned that ALMOST **ALL** routine expense/effort such as like commuting to a physical workplace OR going to funerals or concerts or or college football tailgates or other *cant-miss* events OR flying to *urgent* business meetings and *too important to miss* professional conferences were actually entirely **OPTIONAL**.

The Earth didn't stop spinning and, for almost everyone ... ***life actually found a way to go on*** ... without the entirely **OPTIONAL** routine, formerly unquestioned expense/effort ... yes it was extremely stressful for people and for some it was the straw that broke the camel's back -- but BY ITSELF, being forced to participate in the virtual realm did not kill anyone.

We also saw a gigantic economic change ... meaningful content with Google Analytics tracking became pretty routine and necessary in the 2000s and after 2010 or so the analytics and observability of people interacting with content emerged as a vitally important part of conducting business ... but after 2020, we started seeing that content needs a skillful bench of people looking at analytics dashboards to make that content more responsive, more intelligent but subtly providing business's recommendations, ie past the Google Ads or Amazon product selections based on browser cookies.

So, we are entering a brand new, much SMARTER form of commerce ... in the 2000s was just Google Analytics ... then, in the 2010s, business development and prospecting really changed [Dharmesh Shah](https://network.hubspot.com/profile/dharmesh)'s [The Hubspot Culture Code](https://network.hubspot.com/slides/the-hubspot-culture-code) explained how/why inbound marketing works ... and how/why constant contact email spam just pisses people off ... others like Salesforce based their business franchise on helping businesses **really** understand how to **REALLY** *USE* customer relationship management and business development ***SYSTEMS*** ... to stay in touch with customers in a manner that customers actually somewhat value and respect, ie it is NOT like the annoying email spam that has to be *unsubscribed* every day from the businesses and political organizations that PROVE how clueless they are by using email span. 

Lately, we have seen a gigantic shift toward *shiny* things [which someone thinks are cute] like chatbots and **somewhat** *intelligent* recommender systems ... but frankly, much of the *early* adoption of AI/ML has been painfully, brutually ***ANNOYING*** ... and so annoying that people stopped paying attention AT ALL -- early AI/ML *has been* much like the blinking, flourescent rainbow text of the 90 interwebs, ie fortunately, the AI/ML so far has not quite been bad enough to completely drive ALL people away ... but AI/ML has not ***YET*** *turned the corner* of utilitarian usefulness like email or virtual conferencing. 

AI/ML for accelerating business development will turn that corner ... out of necessity. Enterprise depends upon outreach and NEW customers ... it used to [and still does] depend upon the stall in the bazaar or farmer's market and then auction event or salebarn to develop a reputation, make connections and set a price for premium quality produce ... then outreach became a matter of a bricks and mortar location or a shopping venue which people valued strictly for the experience of shopping -- then online shopping venues established themselves by offering an embarrassingly massive selection of comparable items to shoppers who valued comparison [and sometimes price] over the experience of physical shopping.  

We have not yet seen AI/ML offer RADICALLY compelling reason for customers, shoppers, earnest able-to-pay bidders, appraisers or sellers ... in the manner that Amazon or PayPal / eBay offered RADICALLY more comparison in a massively global sense to their audience of monetizable users ... people are trying lots of things, but it's not yet clear that any of the mud being thrown at the wall is actually *sticking* ... someone's mud will stick and that enterprise will be the next Amazon or PayPal/eBay. 


## Value

You might imagine that you have a pretty good idea of what **value** is, as long as you actually bother to spend some time actually THINKING deeply about what is valuable to you. Most people REFUSE to do this; it makes them a bit uncomfortable -- they prefer to dwell upon what others value, what is currently fashionable or how fashions are changing. The biggest truth of economics is that whatever is truly, intrinsically, deeply valuable to you has absolutely NOTHING whatsoever to do with what is valuable to another person. And vice versa. People might imagaine that value the same things as others, eg a person might value being warm in the Winter or cool in the Summer, but exact degree to which any person values their choice of ideal temperatures settings or the flucuation in temperature over the day or year or lifetime is very, VERY, **VERY** different for each one of us. For more billions different reasons than there are billions of humans.

## Choice

Perceptions, judgements, valuations of **choice** vary immensely ... by the moment ... even in something as mundane and ordinary as the temperature or the comfort settings of our immediate environment.  Of course, physiologically, all of those 9 billion value-ers are basically all the same members of the same species, ie they could have their temperatures managed as if they were livestock [or in prison] but they would lose something intrinsically valuable by having their *temperature* or *ambient comfort* choice taken from them.  Each individual will ***value*** some attribute of some thing, like the air in their immediate environment, differently ... valuation is UNIQUE. Your ***values*** or valuations completely define your life -- although those values shift not just over your life, but from year to year, from day to day and even from second to second. It's almost ridiculous to talk about **shared** values in the inherently ephemeral environment of the human mind ... values are HELD, opinions can be shared, values cannot be shared -- they must be *arrived at* on personal level ... that's why taking **choice** away from human beings is why fights break out, people choose sides and wars and massive killing gets underway. 

The behavioral economists have been pretty effective at pointing the inconsistencies, irrationalities and psychological issues in human choices ... but that should not change things. We should NEVER advocate taking choice away from other human beings unless we really desperately want to initiate an all out war.

[LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) ... or it's [autodidact founder, Eliezer Yudkowsky] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky

# Human capital

Human skills and competencies that have ready buyers and an actively-traded, fungible market.

## Skills

Like technology ... productive assets ... but what or who are skills for?
 
## Talent

Human inventiveness or competency which cannot be automated.

Given the increasing role of automation, the market for human talent has changed DRAMATICALLY in the last 5, 10 or 25 years.  Not everyone gets this ... they choose not to participate in this realm because they still think of resumes, interviews, company visits and rejection *flush* letters as being just like it was 40 years ago. It's not ... now the rejection is more pervasive, less deserving of a flush letter in the mail. The talent game is much TOUGHER than it was 40 years ago ... because companies who are hiring choose to demonstrate their power thoughout the process, ie providing massive clues about what kinds of HELL it is to work inside of those monsters. 

SLOWLY people are getting smarter.  Maybe the rate of change is slow, but by the day ... or even by hour ... people are learning. We see new ways of building professional brands and even earning revenue through the rise of things like subscription-based content provided by professionals with vitally important skills. 

Developing a personal brand ... takes an enormous amount of time, effort and diligent discipline ... it IS a fight. But, slowly humans are becoming more independent in how they work, how they spend their hourly lives ... *slowly*, slowly, SLOWLY we are seeing the demise of slavery, that includes the ***wage*** slavery of typical worklives.

This is all about the listing that companies post ... we are probably not actually going to apply for these positions, but these posted positions do give an indication of what kinds of skills were important when the positions were posted ... things change rapidly, but other than talking directly with companies who need services (ie what inbound marketing is about), there's probably not a better way to find out where the needs for talent/skills is the hottest.
