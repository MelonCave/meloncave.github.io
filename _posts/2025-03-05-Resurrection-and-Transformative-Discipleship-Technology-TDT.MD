This post is specifically about celebrating the [40 days of Lent](#40-days-of-lenten-reflection-for-christian-recovery) also it also introduces the [Melon Cave podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103), which goes to the heart of why I work on something called [Transformative *Discipleship* Technology (TDT)](https://markbruns.github.io/objectives/2024/12/22/Z.html), which is about cognitive awareness, applied neuroscience and Christian mindfulness.

The whole point of TDT is **improved discipleship** ... but in order to get the discipline and better habits we need to get there, TDT helps us reach into transformative areas like neurohacking, music to glorify our Creator, pain management, time management, developing one's meta-cognition skills, become a more proficient human-in-the-loop (HITL) of H-I-T-L machine learning and AI systems, thinking about the algorithms of large-language learning models (LLM) of AI *think*, using AI as a cognitive-support technology. 

[TDT](https://meloncave.github.io/FOSS/0/) is about using ALL of our blessings, that includes our neuroplastic brains, it includes HITL technologies, it includes AI. My perspective is that AI came into existence *specifically for me* in order **to ASSIST ME in better programming myself to ditch the bad habits of being myself.**  Yes, we are indeed richly blessed to be alive in these times. **God is great, ALL THE TIME!**

## 40 Days of Lenten Reflection for Christian Recovery

The 40 Days of Lent offer a particularly important time for reflection, prayer, fasting, almsgiving and contemplation of the Resurrection.

Lent is a good time for challenging or pushing oneself a bit to think about improving the ability to be more compassionate, be more available to help others ... thus, the [Melon Cave podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103) is [the RESULT of thinking harder about getting my act together better, so that I can do more for others](#the-result).

### 1. Acknowledging Wilderness Moments -- March 5

*As Christ spent 40 days in the wilderness being tempted, Lent invites us to confront our own wilderness experiences. Self-compassion during these times teaches us to extend grace to others battling their own demons.*

**Scripture Foundation:** "Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry." ([Matthew 4:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-1.html))

1. How does Christ's forty days in the wilderness help you relate to your own feelings of isolation, temptation, and hunger in recovery?

2. When have you experienced God's presence most clearly in your own "wilderness moments" of addiction, and how might this understanding help you extend compassion to others in similar struggles?

3. How might viewing your recovery journey as a "wilderness time" —difficult but purposeful— change your approach to setbacks and challenges?

### 2. Spiritual Hunger and Fasting -- March 6

*During Lent, we practice intentional sacrifice through fasting, revealing our deeper spiritual hungers. Learning to sit with discomfort rather than numbing it builds compassion for ourselves and others who suffer.*

**Scripture Foundation:** "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God." ([Matthew 4:4](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-4.html))

1. How has your addiction represented a "false fast"—denying yourself authentic connection with God while indulging dependencies that don't truly satisfy?

2. In what ways might the discipline of fasting during Lent help you understand the difference between physical craving and deeper spiritual hunger?

3. How can the experience of healthy self-denial in Lent build compassion for those struggling with the seemingly impossible self-denial required in early recovery?

### 3. Identity and Temptation -- March 7

*Lent reminds us of how Jesus faced temptation by standing firm in His identity. Self-compassion during temptation helps us remember our true identity in Christ, enabling us to help others recognize theirs.*

**Scripture Foundation:** "If you are the Son of God..." ([Matthew 4:3,6](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-3.html)) — Satan's repeated attack on Jesus's identity.

1. How have your addictions or dependencies challenged your understanding of being "fearfully and wonderfully made" ([Psalm 139:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/139/Psalm-139-14.html))?

2. When temptation is strongest, how might claiming your identity as "God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works" ([Ephesians 2:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-10.html)) help you resist?

3. How can recognizing your own struggles with identity and worth help you extend grace to others whose behaviors may stem from similar wounds?

### 4. The Vulnerability of Hunger -- March 8

*Christ's fasting made Him physically vulnerable to temptation. Lent teaches us that acknowledging our vulnerabilities—rather than hiding them—creates space for authentic healing and compassion.*

**Scripture Foundation:** "And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. And the tempter came..." ([Matthew 4:2-3](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/4/Matthew-4-2.html))

1. How has physical or emotional "hunger" made you more vulnerable to your addiction?

2. When have you been able to acknowledge your vulnerability as a strength rather than a weakness, as modeled by Christ?

3. How might honestly admitting your hungers and vulnerabilities help you connect more authentically with others in recovery?

### 5. Surrender and Control -- March 10

*Lent's call to surrender mirrors recovery's first step of acknowledging powerlessness. Self-compassion during surrender builds capacity to walk alongside others as they learn to let go.*

1. How do you distinguish between things you can change and things you must surrender to God, as in "Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you" ([Psalm 55:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/55/Psalm-55-22.html))?

2. What areas of control are hardest for you to release to God's care, and how might practicing surrender during Lent help your recovery journey?

3. How has learning to surrender with self-compassion rather than self-judgment equipped you to guide others through their own processes of letting go?

### 6. Humility and Pride -- March 11

*Christ's wilderness experience demonstrated perfect humility in the face of temptation. Lent invites us to practice humility, opening space for self-compassion where pride once demanded perfection.*

**Scripture Foundation:** "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up." ([James 4:10](https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-10.html))

1. How has pride manifested in your addiction and recovery, considering that "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall" ([Proverbs 16:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-18.html))?

2. In what ways have you resisted "humbling yourself under the mighty hand of God" ([1 Peter 5:6](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-6.html)) during your recovery journey?

3. How might practicing humility during Lent help you extend patience and understanding to others who struggle with admitting their need for help?

### 7. The Rhythm of Confession -- March 12

*Lent's practice of reflection and confession establishes a healing rhythm. Learning self-compassion through confession teaches us to create safe spaces for others to acknowledge their failures.*

**Scripture Foundation:** "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." ([1 John 1:9](https://www.bibleref.com/1-John/1/1-John-1-9.html))

3. How might your experience with confession equip you to listen without judgment when others share their struggles and failures?

### 8. The Desert of Isolation -- March 13

*Christ withdrew into solitude, but never into isolation. During Lent, we learn the difference between sacred solitude and destructive isolation, building self-compassion that recognizes our need for community.*

**Scripture Foundation:** "It is not good for the man to be alone." ([Genesis 2:18](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/2/Genesis-2-18.html))

1. How has isolation contributed to your addiction, contrary to the wisdom that "whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire; he breaks out against all sound judgment" ([Proverbs 18:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/18/Proverbs-18-1.html))?

### 10. The Challenge of Waiting -- March 15

*Lent embodies holy waiting, mirroring recovery's call to patient transformation. Self-compassion during waiting seasons builds capacity to accompany others through their slow processes of change.*

1. How has impatience affected your recovery, contrary to the fruit of the Spirit which includes "patience" ([Galatians 5:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-22.html))?

2. What practices might help you embrace waiting as a sacred discipline during Lent rather than rushing toward immediate relief?

3. How can your own struggles with impatience help you extend grace to others who want instant results in their recovery journeys?

### 11. Temptation's Reality -- March 17

*Christ's wilderness temptations were real, not symbolic. Lent acknowledges the reality of our temptations, fostering self-compassion that recognizes struggle without shame, enabling us to normalize others' battles.*

**Scripture Foundation:** "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin." ([Hebrews 4:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-15.html))

1. How does understanding that "no temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man" ([1 Corinthians 10:13](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-13.html)) affect your perspective on your struggles?

2. When have you experienced the promise that God "will with the temptation also provide the way of escape" ([1 Corinthians 10:13](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/10/1-Corinthians-10-13.html))?

## The Result

The [Melon Cave podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103) is about me and my struggles to CAVE IN the MELONS of the personal demons that I am battling ... because those personal demons stop me from ditching the bad habits of being myself ... and it is those bad personal habits stop me from achieving my most important personal [Objectives](https://markbruns.github.io/Objectives).  ***It's on me to rectify the situation.***

Yes, OF COURSE ... this kind of material is terribly self-absorbed, terribly autobiographical ... that's just too effing bad -- it's basically stuff that I ***should*** listen to myself ... I don't really and can't care if other people listen or don't listen ... I put it into the podcast format for me to listen to -- so, I guess that's just that's how things work ... so I'm not really apologizing for the personal or self-absorbed nature of this [Melon Cave podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103) ...  ... programming myself is what [Transformative Discipleship Technology (TDT)] (https://markbruns.github.io/objectives/2024/12/22/Z.html) is about, ie *trying to benefit others in exactly the same way that I would want to benefit from content myself* ... thus, we have the [Melon Cave podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103).

Hopefully other humans, who might face similar struggles, can benefit from hearing me talk about how impossible these demons have been for me to battle ... but I really do not care if people listen or not. I just want to talk about my demons, and my spiritual battle against them ... it is absolutely a ***spiritual*** sort of battle.

I fully believe that one of the hardest battles any human can ever fight is to battle against the bad habits of being ourselves ... overcoming fear or worry or doubt or laziness or some other deeply, deeply personal flaw or shortcoming ... it's about developing the *little* disciplines, in order to have the discipline muscle to be able to fight larger battles is what I am talking about.

Other people will have different struggles, different obstacles that they overcame ... but they overcame their personal demons by ruthlessly caving in the melons of those demons ... and Melon Cave is not special ... it's just one guy's story about CAVING IN the MELONS of his personal demons.

----

***Lent offers a particularly COMPELLING time for thinking about giving up old comforts and views that have hung around just because it's oh so convenient*** to avoid taking on the PAIN that comes from battling the demons that lead one astray. Those demons have power over us precisely because they are so familiar, so COMFORTABLE, so CONVENIENT -- those demons have the bags of candy that we can't say no to, so we keep our personal demons around ... but Lent is for giving up comfort, giving up convenience and think seriously about what is stopping us from being more effective at helping people. 

We could say that the self-compassion of this nature, or battling one's own demons, is really a big part of the the basis for compassion for others ... but it can't even be about us, or about some nebulous bullshit that falls under the heading of ***Personal Growth***.  Battling our personal demons is MOSTLY about being the warriors that God created, even though we're long overdue in stepping up. We cave in our personal melonsso that we can move forward and actually finally achieve what our Creator created us to achieve. Sure, almsgiving and trying to really help others is a big part of what Lent is for ... any moron can do checkbook charity or whip out the credit card and send $ ... however, this is much more PERSONAL and raw.  

And this cannot aimed at someone else ... my Melon Cave podcast is entirely about MY personal demons. I say that because I know that it's really, really, REALLY important to avoid ever judging someone else -- and of course, I subconsciously do it ... but if I ever realize that I have started thinking that I could help pick the mote out of someone else's eye, then I KNOW that it's a strong signal that I need to focus on dealing with the BEAM of ROUGH-HEWN TIMBER sticking out of my own eyesocket.

During this season of Lent AND I intend to make an annual tradition of this, I am trying harder to renounce my demons ... because it's not about ***Personal Growth*** ... it's because as a Christian, I am obligated to spend this season [*counting THE COST*](https://www.gotquestions.org/count-the-cost.html) per Luke 14:28. The fact of the matter is that allow I have accepted Jesus Christ as my savior long ago there are old demons who have gotten in the way of me FULLY appreciating the cost that was paid. It's time for those demons to have their melons caved in, and those demons are:

### 1.  **Lack of Discipline:** I grapple with inconsistency, which is somewhat driven by my aptitude for easily acquiring skills. 

My inconsistency is MOSTLY driven by my laziness in continously improving self-discipline in all facets of my life. Being blessed with an aptitude to pick up things is no excuse for laziness. This laziness has resulted in a deficiency in honing and mastering skillsets. Doing hard, frustrating things is necessary for sustainably improving my levels discipline for complex projects and ventures requiring more prolonged effort. My tendency towards mercurial, agile, rapidly-adaptive behavior is not exactly something I want to lose, but relying upon it hinders or sabotages my ability to maintain steadfastness.

* "For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control." ([2 Timothy 1:7](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/1/2-Timothy-1-7.html))

* "Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable." ([1 Corinthians 9:24-25](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/9/1-Corinthians-9-24.html))

* "Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be sober-minded; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed." ([1 Peter 1:13](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-13.html))

### 2.  **Absence of Humility:** While I intellectually understand humility, I often operate from a perspective of high self-efficacy.

I exert a lot of effort to quietly be a high-agency person. I vehemently reject any perception of victimhood and resist assistance, asserting my self-sufficiency.  I am offended when someone tries to help me. This inclination, I suspect, is viewed by God as amusing, lamentable and probably even pathetic and WEAK.

* "But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble." ([James 4:6](https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-6.html))

* "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves." ([Philippians 2:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-3.html))

* "Before destruction a man's heart is haughty, and before honor is humility." ([Proverbs 18:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/18/Proverbs-18-12.html))

### 3.  **Egotism:** Particularly in situations that evoke insecurity, such as professional interactions or familial scrutiny.

I tend to dominate conversations, especially in situations where I feel that I have something to prove. Instead of fostering dialogue by doing more to encourage others to share. Pauses tend to intimidate me even when I am not conscious that I am feeling intimdated. As a result, I often fill silences with my own perspectives. Part of this tendency stems from a perceived obligation to entertain, to lead, to carry the interaction; I am under no such obligation, but when I am tired, depressed or not thinking clearly I am subject to this faulty perception.

"Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person." ([Colossians 4:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/4/Colossians-4-6.html))

"A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion." ([Proverbs 18:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/18/Proverbs-18-2.html))

* "Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise; when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent." ([Proverbs 17:28](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/17/Proverbs-17-28.html))

### 4.  **Negativity and Judgment:** I can be negative or rush to judgement in viewing situations that are beyond my direct responsibility. 

This manifests as a harshly critical and reproachful attitude, marked by uncharitably low expectations of others and a tendency to aim low or underestimate of their efforts. I am particularly prone to judging others' struggles with their stupid self-defeating behaviors, a reflection of my own past and potential present challenges -- the answer is rooted in a lack of faith and spiritual discipline.

#### Scriptural Basis For The Larger Strategy of Caving In The Melon Of This Demon

* "Therefore **encourage one another and build one another up**, just as you are doing." ([1 Thessalonians 5:11](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-11.html))

* "Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the beam that is in your own eye?" ([Matthew 7:3](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/7/Matthew-7-3.html))

* "Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved." ([Psalm 55:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/55/Psalm-55-22.html))

### 5.  **Inappropriate Humor:** I have a strong tendency to find humor in others' struggles, particularly when those struggles are related to material concerns.

It's one thing to worry about how we will manage the immediate day, but worrying excessively or obsessing about material wealth, particularly when it is seen as indicator or status or value of a person actually IS INSANELY STUPID. I have learned over time that I will find a way to adapt, adjust, improvise, overcome ... and even without my own efforts ... it is CERTAINLY true that people of faith should understand why, by the grace of our Creator, we are directly admonished by Jesus Christ not to worry about such things. Since worrying about material well-being is a sign of stupidity for me, I often dismiss anxieties about financial comfort as trivially hilarious, believing that affluence contributes to dissatisfaction. Of course, this inclination reflects an unkindness towards those who express financial worries; I should not find humor in their struggles *but I do*.

* "A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones." ([Proverbs 17:22](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/17/Proverbs-17-22.html)) However, this does not give us permission to make fun of others struggles.

* "Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep." ([Romans 12:15](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-15.html))

* "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear." ([Ephesians 4:29](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-29.html))

### Conclusion

I have attempted to examines five major spiritual challenges: lack of discipline despite natural aptitude, absence of true humility while maintaining high self-efficacy, egotism in conversation particularly when insecure, negativity in judging others' struggles, and inappropriate humor toward others' material concerns. These weaknesses require **spiritual** transformation through contemplative implementation of biblical principles of self-control ([Galatians 5:23](https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/5/Galatians-5-23.html)), humility ([James 4:10](https://www.bibleref.com/James/4/James-4-10.html)), thoughtful speech ([Proverbs 15:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-1.html)), loving judgment ([John 7:24](https://www.bibleref.com/John/7/John-7-24.html)), and compassion ([Colossians 3:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/3/Colossians-3-12.html)). I framed each challenge as a "demon" to be overcome through scriptural guidance, and the choice of vivid language about "caving in the melon" is necessary [for me to think about wrestling with these demons] to overcome these spiritual obstacles. I recognize that transformation requires both divine grace ([2 Corinthians 12:9](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Corinthians/12/2-Corinthians-12-9.html)) and personal responsibility ([Philippians 2:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Philippians/2/Philippians-2-12.html)), while I am seek to develop Christ-like character ([Romans 8:29](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/8/Romans-8-29.html)) through continual, daily renewal ([Romans 12:2](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-2.html)) and reliance on God's strength ([Isaiah 40:31](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/40/Isaiah-40-31.html)).

### What's NEXT

It will, of course, be a longer haul than just 40 days of Lent ... my [personal objectives](https://markbruns.github.io/Objectives) represent a continual, year-round commitment to achieving things that are personally vitally important to me ... but during Lent, I need to work a bit harder, thinking about what comforts and conveniences that I need to give up ... there are excuses and psychological comforts in these these particular faults that I need to do without.

By acknowledging these weaknesses and grounding my efforts in scripture, I HOPE to cultivate greater self-awareness and spiritual growth. *I would ask people to pray for me, but* I suppose I will egotistically say something like "These are my crosses to bear." I guess I would rather have them make jokes about what an idiot I can be ... but I realize that people might be intimidated by the judgemental asshole I can be.

In the final, most concluding of concluding remarks, these five things are what I believe:

1) I DO have all the answers; *just ask me* ... ***I actually am joking***, can't resist it, the assertion that I know the answers is the kind of thing that's supposed to be funny -- the HARD truth is that caving in the melons of my personal demons will be a much longer haul than just 40 days; if I have 40 years left to live, even that amount of time will be insufficient.

2) Being NICE is closely aligned with PURE evil ... basically a MATCH for it. The most wicked demons have big bags of sweet candy of exactly the kind that we dream about ... the mostly evil demons are FULL of platitudes about kindness, compassion and NICE WORDS ... caving in the melons of personal demons requires ACTUAL action ... and repentance and begging for forgiveness when the backsliding happens ... but it's like any recovery plan that has a PRAYER of actually working -- it requires acknowledging a Higher Power AND that means telling those who are merely NICE to fuck off.

3) I am not a nice guy or a reasonable; I have not intentions of becoming a nice or reasonable guy. I am RAW and brutally FRANK, because I trying to be as HONEST with myself and others as is possible ... and my intention is to become a better disciple of Jesus Christ ... that doesn't mean being a nice guy like someone's IMAGINARY sunday school Jesus -- it means being a RAW, brutally FRANK, HONEST ... as close to Jesus as possible ... Jesus who was never exhibited any fear of either embarrassment, demons, the baddest of bad ass centurions, or even groups of people in dominant governmental empires or sanctimonious religious bodies. If Christians were actually more like Jesus, there would not be any problems evangelizing the One Way to God.

4) I actually realize that I am quite vulnerable, but also still mean as fuck ... *so don't get any ideas* ... once again, ***that's a joke, it's supposed to be funny, even though it isn't*** -- the point I am attempting to make is that I'm vulnerable and I don't care. My soul is more important.

5) We are all spiritual beings. We have souls, unless we believe and go out of our way to CHOOSE to act as if we are soulless. We get to choose. Our spiritual essence transcends all time ... which means that when we pray to be WITH God, to have his Will be done -- that means that we ask that God be with our SOULS, not our egos and not our psychological personnas ... we ask God to give our souls the grace of being filled with the Holy Spirit and we try to ditch our egos and try to ditch the VERY TEMPORARY notions of *personal* growth. This is about becoming the spiritual being that God created us to be.

Hopefully, this explains WHY this lenten season before Easter offers a particularly COMPELLING time for kicking off this Melon Cave podcast ... now is the time to CAVE IN the MELONS of my personal demons.
