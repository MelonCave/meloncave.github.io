The [MelonCave podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103) is now available.

It's about cognitive strategies for removing the bad habits of being yourself, ie CAVE in the MELON of the idiot ruining your life.

## FIRST remove the Stupid 

**Ditch the cognitive strategies that have calicified into the bad [mental] habits of being yourself.** You should not expect that ANYBODY is coming to save you from yourself ... it's up to YOUR to work harder at saving yourself from your evil self. If YOU are defensive about your own bad habits or want to blame how you are undermining yourself on ANYONE else ... guess what, then YOU are the problem; the more defensive you get about your bad habits, the more you become the UGLY, TOXIC person in your life. 

**You have to remove the TOXICITY of being yourself.**

BEFORE we can really move on to exploiting the full potential of the human brain, we need to address the fact that most people are not even using a full percent of their brain's capacity ... and that's because most people are devoting their brain's processing power to RUNNING FROM PAIN ... or running from tedium and tried to hide from their feelings of of worthlessness ... which are fully justified by their own subconscious which is screaming at them "KNOCK OFF YOUR DAMNED WHINING!"

1) *Stop* **running** *from pain by engaging victim-mode thinking, self-pity, indulgence, entitlement* ... *USE PAIN* by leaning into it ... use exercise, but ditch alcohol, stress-eating, passive consumption of any form of media, ie not just no teevee or movies, but no youtube vids or podcasts -- READ more, think through what you read and APPLY in it your exercise regimen ... you will need to work on leaning in to pain and understanding your own thought processes and addictive tendencies ... you will NEED to be more self-obsessed, self-absorbed and less concerned with appearances and what you IMAGINE others might think, ie other people don't really care.

2) *AVOID those who engage in WEAK, victim-mode thinking* ... this includes with any kind conspiracy thinking bs [which is always about IMAGINING dark forces have any more impact on one's life than allowing the demons to live rent-free in one's mind by engaging in such pathetic, weak-minded thinking] ... stay away from the worriers and self-pitiers [with any kind of dwelling on how their enemies are attacking them] ... a warrior doesn't worry much about what an enemy is going to do to him -- he's pre-occupied with what he need to do to the enemy ... stay far away from those with any form of indulgence thinking that leads to alcohol consumption, bad food choices or entertainment for the sake of distracting a person from a pathetic life, ie when your life sucks, ATTACK the root cause of the problem to make it stop sucking ... stay far, FAR AWAY from any sort of entitlement thinking that justifies self-pity and indulgence or inflicting costs on others with noise, pollution, externalization of costs, etc ... you should be working every day on adding value, eg through open source projects, building up your own strength and the strength of those around you; find people who push you harder to contribute ... AVOID those who are not working on themselves and their own strength.

3) *Work harder on your forgiveness skills* ... NEVER EVER HATE ... develop strategies for leveling up your forgiveness skills. Pray harder for assistance in developing your forgiveness skills than you pray for stuff people anyone [including you] thinks they need ... people NEED to stop hating themselves, hating others, hating the world and FORGIVE MORE ... let go of more shit.

4) *Work harder on your gratitude skills* ... develop strategies for leveling up your gratitude skills. Develop better strategies for building your knowledge in ***gratitude engineering*** and leveling up your legit THANKFULNESS skills with daily gratitude stretching exercises and workout regimens.

5) *Work harder on your empathy and compassion skills* ... AVOID checkbook charity like the plague that it is ... stop enabling any form of IDIOT compassion or any form of just enabling bad habits ... develop strategies for building your knowledge in ***compassion engineering*** and leveling up your legit empathy skills with daily empathy stretching exercises and workout regimens.

6) *Work harder on your prayer life* ... don't JUST spend more time in prayer; improve the quality and punch of your prayer life ... develop strategies for leveling up your skills in prayer and meditation.

7) *Work harder on building your "courage muscles"* ... this is **not** about taking stupid dares or doing idiotic things to confront people or jump out of airplanes ... this is about things like public speaking ... this is about starting businesses or venture philanthropies or any kind of public exercise that almost certainly will fail many times before it succeeds ... this about taking risks in looking like like you're flailing about as a "fish out of water" learning new things ... you are NOT going to become fearless by watching MOVIES about combat, ie moviewatching is NOTHING BUT **passively** watching movies.

8) *Work harder on building your "strength muscles"* ... this is PARTLY about physical strength, but the mindset for doing that and the little motivational tricks or nudges that that one develops also carry over to one's cognitive strategies for building mental strength or accuity, emotional strength or resilience, spiritual strength.

9) *Work harder on building your "wisdom muscles"* ... this is about developing strategies for leveling up your wisdom skills ... this is about developing strategies for building your knowledge in ***wisdom engineering*** and leveling up your legit wisdom skills with daily wisdom stretching exercises and workout regimens.

10) *Work harder on building your capacity for LOVE and joy* ... this is about developing strategies for leveling up your joy and love skills ... this is about developing strategies for building your knowledge in ***joy engineering*** and leveling up your abilities to legit LOVE your fellow human beings ... with daily love stretching exercises and workout regimens.

## How efficient are human brains at processing complex neuroprocessing?

The REASON that we want to explore cognitve strategies to manage pain is that the human brain is BARELY UTILIZED because most people are devoting their brain's processing power to RUNNING FROM PAIN ... or running from tedium and tried to hide from their feelings of of worthlessness [which are fully justified by their own subconscious which is screaming at them "Stop WHINING! Get off your ass or get out of bed and DO SOMETHING!"] ... so as a result of completely failed approaches to cognitive strategies, starting with something like pain management, most humans are not even using a full percent their brains to that 1 per cent's fullest capacities.

*Don't believe me!* ... think for yourself ... [listen to somebody like Jim Keller on open source, hyper-innovation, why RISC-V will quickly be obsolete and the foreseeable next decade or two of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EAY4UzPD0Y&t=954s) ... the hype of AI is not as big as AI is going to be in the realm of computational power.

To cut to the chase, the obvious takehome LESSON from the front of the front lines of chip designers building chips for AI is that the design of the next generations of silicon computing architecture is that silicon can only take us so far -- at a certain point in the realm of AI HYPER-INNOVATION, silicon cannot get out of its own way as old machines have to be decommisioned after a few weeks in service because of obsolescene ... **humans need to start getting really serious about LEARNING to really use their brains and retraining their brains scientifically taking advantage of their carbon-based neuron's neuroplasticity ... human's at first, need to level up their think game to achieve use of at least a few percent of their brain's capacity.**

The human brain consumes approximately 20 watts of power on average ... but generally much less, maybe only a couple watts or even a fraction of a watt in a meditative, but aware state ... brains are subject to fritterware, bad relationships, ***stupidfuck salesguys who should have their melons caved in*** and distractifying technology ... worse, many people do not ever address the causes of their attention deficit ... many humans crave the dopamine hit of maintaining a state of hyperarousal and they do not feel comfortable unless their brain is typically multitasking ... most human brains [in affluent cultures] are probably dominated by programmed worries and fears from a human's media consumption ... it's important to stress the importance of Melon Cave being, first of all an ANTI-media media ... it's IMPERATIVE that people shut off their media and regain control of their own minds. 

The human brain's power consumption is a relatively small amount compared to many electronic devices ... it's not even equivalent to the power required for a light bulb and on average less than even the consumption of a flashlight. Despite the brain's low power consumption, it is enormously efficient and powerful in terms of processing. The average human brain is estimated to have the equivalent processing power of slightly more than 1 exaFLOP (1 quintillion or 10^18 floating-point operations per second); as with all human attributes there are probably humans with capacities that double this. Oddly enough, the human processing power of 1 exaFLOP is comparable to what is currently the world's very most powerful supercomputer, which has a peak performance of 1.1 exaFLOPS. OBVIOUSLY, the problem with most human brains is that they are not being used in a focused manner, with the majority of an individual brain's processing power actually devoted to serving the individual's own best interests ... let alone, not being used to their fullest capacities ... which would be far beyond the 1 exaFLOP estimate, if humans actually trained their brains as athletes strength train for jumping ability. Also, we certainly know that humans are natively better at processing the highest human emotions, eg showing love/empathy or creatively commanding the battle in problem-solving strategies for gigantically important problems.

A really high-end computer workstation used for computer-aided design (CAD) or as a high-end game rig will typically consume between 500-1000 watts and some might even consume close to 2000 watts under peak, depending on the specifications and workload ... whereas an average desktop computer or miniPC will consume about 1/10th of what a high end workstation does, but still 10X more than the human brain. The world's world's most powerful supercomputer (as of August 2023): The Frontier supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States has a power consumption of approximately 21 megawatts (21 million watts) when running at full capacity. The Frontier supercomputer has a peak performance of 1.1 exaFLOPS.

It is true that modern smartphone has lower consumption than a human brain, since it typically consumes around 2-5 watts when in use, and less than 1 watt when idle ... HOWEVER most of the processing power of smartphones is actually used to distract or hyperarouse human beings ... a smartphone is actually more akin to a high end workstation being shutdown by a false warning from a connected printer telling the user that the printer has an urgent error with a partially full ink cartridge ... MOST OF THE TIME, smartphone should be isolated from its owner. As we all forget, the human owner is practically the LAST person on Earth who is actually in control of the processing power of a smartphone. It might seem severe to those who are addicted to their smartphones, but not exactly wrong to say that humanity would probably be better off if the smartphone-as-tethering-device to control humans were never invented ... VERY FEW people are actually remotely close to being able to even think about UNTETHERING themselves from their smartphones.
