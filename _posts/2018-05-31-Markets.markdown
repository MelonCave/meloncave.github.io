If, for some reason, you have not yet read and re-read Charlie Koch's book on "The Science of Success," you should correct that deficiency ... at a minimum, you should at least understand the [guiding principles of Market Based Management](https://www.kochind.com/assets/files/mbm_guiding_principles.pdf) ... and many something about WHY it matters, ie understand the history behing this philosophy BEFORE you dismiss it.  If you ever disrespect this philosophy in my presence and also indicate that you have not bothered to investigate it or understand why PHILOSOPHICALLY it is important, you will be very sorry. I am not referring to nitpicking criticisms in the implementation of philosophy or seeming hypocrisy of Koch Industries -- I am referring to respect for the philosophy itself.

Fred C. Koch spent time developing petroleum cracking units in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin's regime between 1929 and 1932 and came back with a deep disdain for the communist regime's totalitarianism. He described the nation as "a land of hunger, misery, and terror," and later, lamented the fact that many of the engineers he had worked with there had been purged by Stalin's regime, along with a great many other "intellectuals". Driven by a personal appreciation that TENS of MILLIONS of the brightest, most capable, most talented people had died because of communism, the Kochs understood the necessity of freedom to the success of societies, and translated that necessity into their business practices — Market-Based Management is ALSO the working business philosophy for Salebarn.com.

The Salebarn.com implementation will be different than the Koch Industries approach ... there's no need to repeat what Koch is doing; they are doing a fine job and must execute within the parameters of their business, with their personnel and resources. The implementation will be different. The philosophy is essentially the same.

#  Integrity

*Conduct all affairs with integrity, for which courage is the foundation.*

#  Compliance

*Strive for 10,000% compliance with all laws and regulations, which requires 100% of employees fully complying 100% of the time. Stop, think and ask.*

The core thing here is that nobody really likes restrictions and constraints and often the need for regulations is not thoroughly understood, but we operate in regulated environments where stakeholders MATTER ... this is the ESSENTIAL thing that the naive people behind SilkRoad got very, very wrong and that is why, justifiably so, the founder is going to be in prison for a very long time. Really trying to get 100% of the people involved at least trying to be in 100% compliance is essential.
