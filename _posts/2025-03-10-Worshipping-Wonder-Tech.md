# So That We May BETTER Train Ourselves

The antidote to easy button confusion that enables the root causes generating problems is that we have to train ourselves.

We have to train ourselves how to train ourselves.

If we want to train ourselves, we are going to have stop worshipping the new wonder tech ... whether it's AI or pharma, shiny new wonder tech is always just like the shiny new wonder tech of yesteryear ... and that does not mean than the tech does not have some really sharp and useful aspects ... there certainly ARE some extremely sharp needles in the haystack of hype. 

It really is just like what a wise old retired friend once told me about the internet in the late 1990s ... oddly enough, he was, at that time, about the age that I am now ... "***With this MUCH horse manure, there has to be one heckuva pony in here somewhere.***" 

## Recognizing Easy Button Addiction Pushed By The Hypesters -- Stop Worshipping Wondertech

By now, we all know that [BRP (derived from its parent pro-hormone BRINP2)](https://x.com/i/grok/share/Iay4GNKd24lHCZqr7ujuONMqa), promises advancement in obesity treatment, ie, same positive effects similar to the [frequently misused semaglutide, Ozempic](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384093/) -- hopefully, BRP is better targeted with less negative side effects, or at least without Ozempic's side effects. 

We also know that [the AI tool used in the discovery of BRP, Peptide Predictor](https://x.com/i/grok/share/2gJGAziKxQjzdDrETr2uqDVNR) blends bioinformatics and AI to reduce time/cost of DRUG DISCOVERY by [automating target identification, hit screening, and lead optimization](https://x.com/i/grok/share/z9Lgb8pS5oqIBhjR1JJqKe2C9). We know something about how AI works in [proteomics](https://x.com/i/grok/share/ffGQMCx8Kbm1cVaA2jSQ4Euk7), [metabolomics](https://x.com/i/grok/share/IpKVJm4pc0VFzJr5OkUKFfwPF), [lipidomics](https://x.com/i/grok/share/IVzefw6x1N92y5VddXqHvZYOX) OR [glycomics](https://x.com/i/grok/share/d4b1XXLOXzTkapvlW0i7e3eaR) for DRUG DISCOVERY.

But let's say that we are interested in [AI assisting us in lifestyle and diet choices](https://x.com/i/grok/share/yCx1ZDcMqxmP1YaYZX86BsuGb) RATHER than opting for a lifestyle built around addictions to wonder drugs or the pushers that prescribe these drugs? Is there something more newsworthy than flogging the same old drug-intensive lifestyles OR [fitness apps that have been re-branded to feature a claim that they use AI](https://x.com/i/grok/share/cU2ZyIZXRuNupQ1MI7wKlcJnU)?

### How Do Humans Overcome The Root Cause of Their Problems

It's relatively easy to critique of the "easy button" — drugs like Ozempic or BRP are chosen RATHER THAN addressing lifestyle root causes — in order to enable addiction. It's much tougher to parse the cascading oceans of hype.

*How does one do that?* To make a very long story short -- it's HARD. If you want to know how hard, take a look at 100 process suggestions given below. 

There's no substitute for INFORMED process improvement; you can't really, you're stuck with too much information from now on ... you almost need AI to parse the hourly tsunamis driving the hype oceans. In other words, if you ***wanna find the pony, you're going to have to get a lot better at filtering and using the AI tools to sort through a lot more AI-automated sciencey horse manure.***

The 100 ways given below are only *examples* of how to start prioritizing understanding and high-agency over easy button dependence. 

AI should be used as a tool for empowerment, not just drug discovery for pharma addicts. While AI can optimize proteomics for pharma profits, it’s equally capable of analyzing personal data (diet, sleep, mood) to suggest sustainable shifts, as seen in items like AI mood coaching or habit trackers. The newsworthiness lies in this pivot: AI isn’t just rebranding fitness apps — it’s enabling a rebellion against a drug-addicted, quick-fix culture. People are waking up to this, and that’s where the real story is. 

The heart of a tension between quick-fix solutions and addressing root causes. We already know more than we need to know about the AI magic of BRP or Peptide Predictor ... this list is about provoking thought focus instead on the broader question of overcoming harmful habits through understanding and adaptation.
