The weekly MelonCave podcast episode is available at [Meditative Pain Mgmt and Why Human Cognitive Processing Power Per Watt Dominates](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103/site/meditative-pain-mgmt-and-why-human-cognitive-processing-power-per-watt-dominates).


# Syllabus for a year-long graduate level or post-graduate level study 

This is only a SUGGESTED outline of an intensive multi-disciplinary curriculum drawing on knowledge from medicine, nursing, psychology, physical therapy, complementary medicine, theology, and other fields to provide a holistic and integrative approach to pain care. 

The point is to put it INTO PRACTICE IN PAIN MGMT EXERCISE OPPORTUNITIES IN ONE'S OWN LIFE ... to **emphasize** non-pharmacological pain management strategies including meditation, prayer, and neuroexercise ... although resorting to the *nuclear option* ... in small doses, eg taking an aspirin, OR going full out to destroy the mind and end the pain ... is always an option. The curriculum is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of individual learners, with opportunities for self-directed study, group discussion, and hands-on practice.

The coursework spans from fundamental pain concepts to advanced subspecialty considerations. Modules incorporate readings, lectures, case discussions, practical exercises, and reflection on the spiritual dimensions of pain and its relief.

**The inescapablity of inevitable pain of one sort or another is THE DEFINING REALITY of the human condition.**

## Course Objective

The **OBJECTIVE** of this course of study to **develop a personalized pain mgmt training discipline** that one uses every day to implement practical cognitive strategies and implementing a neuroexercise workthough routine for pain management and learning as much as possible from pain, **rather than running from it.**

Th objective IS NOT to make pain go away ... pain is a part of LIFE and a blessing in terms of the information our own lives as well as the empathy for others that the signal pain provide ... the objective is building this cognitive discipline is to reduce the noise and increase the value of the signal. **DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM**

*Changing the psychological stance towards pain is the first step in actually USING pain as a aid to improve our lives and the lives of those around us ... because the Reality of coming across physical, emotional, spiritual pain that won't leave us alone in our lives just ain't going away for any of us*.

## How efficient are human brains at processing complex neuroprocessing?

The REASON that we want to explore cognitve strategies to manage pain is that the human brain is BARELY UTILIZED because most people are devoting their brain's processing power to RUNNING FROM PAIN ... or running from tedium and tried to hide from their feelings of of worthlessness [which are fully justified by their own subconscious which is screaming at them "Stop WHINING! Get off your ass or get out of bed and DO SOMETHING!"] ... so as a result of completely failed approaches to cognitive strategies, starting with something like pain management, most humans are not even using a full percent their brains to that 1 per cent's fullest capacities.

*Don't believe me!* ... think for yourself ... [listen to somebody like Jim Keller on open source, hyper-innovation, why RISC-V will quickly be obsolete and the foreseeable next decade or two of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EAY4UzPD0Y&t=954s) ... the hype of AI is not as big as AI is going to be in the realm of computational power.

To cut to the chase, the obvious takehome LESSON from the front of the front lines of chip designers building chips for AI is that the design of the next generations of silicon computing architecture is that silicon can only take us so far -- at a certain point in the realm of AI HYPER-INNOVATION, silicon cannot get out of its own way as old machines have to be decommisioned after a few weeks in service because of obsolescene ... **humans need to start getting really serious about LEARNING to really use their brains and retraining their brains scientifically taking advantage of their carbon-based neuron's neuroplasticity ... human's at first, need to level up their think game to achieve use of at least a few percent of their brain's capacity.**

The human brain consumes approximately 20 watts of power on average ... but generally much less, maybe only a couple watts or even a fraction of a watt in a meditative, but aware state ... brains are subject to fritterware, bad relationships, ***stupidfuck salesguys who should have their melons caved in*** and distractifying technology ... worse, many people do not ever address the causes of their attention deficit ... many humans crave the dopamine hit of maintaining a state of hyperarousal and they do not feel comfortable unless their brain is typically multitasking ... most human brains [in affluent cultures] are probably dominated by programmed worries and fears from a human's media consumption ... it's important to stress the importance of Melon Cave being, first of all an ANTI-media media ... it's IMPERATIVE that people shut off their media and regain control of their own minds. 

The human brain's power consumption is a relatively small amount compared to many electronic devices ... it's not even equivalent to the power required for a light bulb and on average less than even the consumption of a flashlight. Despite the brain's low power consumption, it is enormously efficient and powerful in terms of processing. The average human brain is estimated to have the equivalent processing power of slightly more than 1 exaFLOP (1 quintillion or 10^18 floating-point operations per second); as with all human attributes there are probably humans with capacities that double this. Oddly enough, the human processing power of 1 exaFLOP is comparable to what is currently the world's very most powerful supercomputer, which has a peak performance of 1.1 exaFLOPS. OBVIOUSLY, the problem with most human brains is that they are not being used in a focused manner, with the majority of an individual brain's processing power actually devoted to serving the individual's own best interests ... let alone, not being used to their fullest capacities ... which would be far beyond the 1 exaFLOP estimate, if humans actually trained their brains as athletes strength train for jumping ability. Also, we certainly know that humans are natively better at processing the highest human emotions, eg showing love/empathy or creatively commanding the battle in problem-solving strategies for gigantically important problems.

A really high-end computer workstation used for computer-aided design (CAD) or as a high-end game rig will typically consume between 500-1000 watts and some might even consume close to 2000 watts under peak, depending on the specifications and workload ... whereas an average desktop computer or miniPC will consume about 1/10th of what a high end workstation does, but still 10X more than the human brain. The world's world's most powerful supercomputer (as of August 2023): The Frontier supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States has a power consumption of approximately 21 megawatts (21 million watts) when running at full capacity. The Frontier supercomputer has a peak performance of 1.1 exaFLOPS.

It is true that modern smartphone has lower consumption than a human brain, since it typically consumes around 2-5 watts when in use, and less than 1 watt when idle ... HOWEVER most of the processing power of smartphones is actually used to distract or hyperarouse human beings ... a smartphone is actually more akin to a high end workstation being shutdown by a false warning from a connected printer telling the user that the printer has an urgent error with a partially full ink cartridge ... MOST OF THE TIME, smartphone should be isolated from its owner. As we all forget, the human owner is practically the LAST person on Earth who is actually in control of the processing power of a smartphone. It might seem severe to those who are addicted to their smartphones, but not exactly wrong to say that humanity would probably be better off if the smartphone-as-tethering-device to control humans were never invented ... VERY FEW people are actually remotely close to being able to even think about UNTETHERING themselves from their smartphones.
