In its earlier incarnation, Salebarn.com was primarily an open source technology project ... working the realm of the LAMP stack and tools for applications like online auction and messaging updates from auction, this primarily translated into participation in MySQL and CGI scripts to serve data from MySQL to webpages -- so this also meant the Apache webserver as well as other scripting languages, not just Perl, and also to tweaking Linux.

# History

In order to envision the best path going forward, it is somewhat instructive to spend a moment or two looking back and understanding something about the history of open source. It's perhaps difficult for people who didn't work in the realm of open source back in the 1990s to fully understand and appreciate how remarkable the whole emergence of those first major open source communities was ... there weren't really that many paradigms to fall back on or rules to follow and we were working with unsupported code on really limited machines with severe bandwidth limitations -- there was nothing like Google or StackExchange or anything in the way of quick and easy answers that are so incredibly useful, necessary [and taken for granted nowadays] ... even the awesome books from OReilly were not free or that easy to obtain and, even the great ones were at least a couple years behind the curve ... one had to sort of see around corners in order to know where to begin looking for information. A lot of times, there was no available information -- one just had to figure something out.

But the community of developers and hackers was beyond AMAZING ... as it is now, but maybe even moreso, back then! Yes, there were prickly, irascible jerks [who probably had a large enough sysadmin workload on their plate already and didn't have time to add to that workload]... and there were people who didn't have a clue what they were doing but were still offering advice as if they were seasoned experts or hacker sensei ... and there were other aspects of the global open source circus that could be more like a drug-addled, weaponized Wild West freak show at times than something that one wanted to participate in ... and there were the *little* things, like the NATO bombing Serbia that directly impacted some key developers and thus the progress of key portions of code for everyone in the world.  But it was just so ... so FREE!

The point here is that OPEN SOURCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FIGHT ... having too many different AWESOME open source libraries is a really great problem to have; having companies like AWS roll out services faster than you can shake a stick at them is really great problem to have; having way too many options is really great problem to have ... yes it takes a little effort finding an implementing solutions, but that's not really HARD ... the really HARD stuff is SIMPLIFICATION, but whenever what you're working on is easy to the point of being tedious and predictable, maybe you're working on the wrong things; maybe you're not working on the stuff that matters; maybe you're working on fluff -- THE POINT OF OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPMENT IS ABOUT MAKE THE PEOPLE WHO DO IT MORE FREE THAN THEY WERE BEFORE. It's not an entitlement; it's not for people who can't take a punch in the feels -- legit open source is a FIGHT!  Every hour, every day.

# Disruption

The main technology of Salebarn.com is disruption. The core tool that we are building in order to be more disruptive is our Disruptive Engine, a Git intelligence tool -- something that allows us to follow new stuff, before anyone knows that it's the next big new thing ... think of it as you might think of Netflix Chaos Monkey ... except that its not so much about simulated chaos, it's about looking REAL chaos ... we are looking at real development chaos as an enabling technology for finding better, different ways to get past problems in development, not as something that we are trying to avoid so that our users can watch videos without any buffering issues.
