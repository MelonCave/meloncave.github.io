One of the DEMONS that I am wrestling with is the demon that pushes me to ignore issues, rather than address them. This is true for how I regard others, but more importantly, perhaps this is also true of how I treat myself ... ***I'm trying to cave in the melon of this demon.***

If somebody actually, really GENUINELY cares about you ... they will ask you ... *in a compassionate but firm manner, appropriate for your level of development and that expects you to be great and achieve that you find fulfilling* ... **"What did you get done today?"**  

This question is also necessary for our interior dialogue, it goes to the core of how we treat ourselves.

Self-compassion needs to be driven by the compassion for one's future self AND the better world that the future high-agency self will enables ... genuine LOVE is NOT really about hugs and kisses ... some people are huggers; some just aren't ... REAL love about EXPECTING big things AND caring enough to assist in a way that might be feasible with information provided from this question -- it's about ***being*** REAL, in the way that God is REAL.

God is REAL, because God IS what made you ... what made you IS God ... that is DEFINITIONAL, not a matter of faith -- it's a matter of what the word means. Whatever it is that MADE you IS God ... that's the DEFINITION of God. God is REAL. If you say that God is dead or doesn't exist -- it means that your soul is dead and you're just a zombie consuming nutrients/resources, but your soul is dead. You don't have to be dead -- because your God is REAL.

As our Creator loves us, our Creators EXPECTS greater things from us -- but our Creator is also merciful and understands that trying to create a better world is frustrating, thankless and impossibly hard. Our Creator will never give up on us or our missions -- ***the essence of being a warrior is to never give up on the mission.*** Don't give up on yourself -- be compassionate to your future self AND to the better world that your future high-agency self will help bring about.

## The Starter Set of Self-Compassion Questions

In order to flesh out that question, there are 100 questions to ponder on this starter set of Examen questions given below. Take your time with these in the list ... read the ENTIRE list first, in the list's complete TOTALITY ... feel free to re-invent your own Examen list after understanding the gist of what an Examen list is about.

The questions are for you to ponder -- there are not right or wrong answers, EXCEPT that ducking any question is very definitely the wrong approach to pondering such questions. 

Read the entire list slowly, let the questions sink in ... JUST reading the list and letting the questions really sink in might be enough for the first time or two.

EVENTUALLY, after you've read/digested the whole list, you are going to craft your own set of 10 questions ... it's probably best to go with quality over quantity, but we'll set the number at ten -- *you can raise or lower that number, but pick a number that works, a number that you will actually USE.*

You want to end up the ten very best, very toughest, vert most compassionate but still driving questions that allow you to look in the mirror and ask yourself each day that go to the heart of "What did you get done today?"

## Next, The 10 Question Distillation Assignment for DAILY Examen Questions

Now that you have read the full list over a couple times, you might notice some that seem redundant ... some might seem trite ... others might make you slightly uneasy or uncomfortable. The questions on the list are just simple questions ... but NOW the toughest part of assignment is up to you.

Come up with TEN questions that you will ask yourself EVERY DAY.

You might pick ten that hit hard and feel right for you, or you might blend a few into hybrid questions that pack a punch. For example, combining "Did I push past discomfort?" and "Did I make progress on a goal?" could become "Did I push through discomfort to move a goal forward?"  But the style of the question has to be something that is authentic and best for you. 

Your ten questions might change as you change ... or they might be consistent.

The assignment is NOT for anybody else ... your questions should be designed by you for you to spark your own self-awareness, accountability, and growth while balancing a degree of kindness toward yourself ... you probably want to make sure they’re tough enough to keep you honest, kind enough to keep you going, and driving or inspiring enough to push you in ways that you need to be pushed. The best form of motivation does not come from a boss or coach or some external force -- it comes from within, from within the soul that your Creator created your soul to be. 

## The NEXT next Assignment, AFTER You Distilled and Defined Your Daily Examen Questions

Take EACH of your ten questions and ask Grok3 or your favorite AI assistants to give you 100 questions to help you think more deeply about your list of ten Examen questions.

Your math is correct ... that will be 1000 new questions to ponder -- but the point of the follow-on assignment is entirely about DEEPENING and perfecting your critical ten *"What did I do today"* Examen questions. 

### An Example ... on the topic of making promises and setting boundaries

*For the sake of illustration,* you might find a question like ... *"Did I follow through on a promise—to myself or someone else? Have I been aggressive enough or too aggressive on making promises to others?"* ... to be one of your ten questions that was PARTICULARLY worthy of more contemplation and pondering and on the basise of asking Grok3 to furnish you with 100 more questions to help me think about this ONE question, you arrived at the realization that you need to think more about setting boundaries. 

Setting boundaries is about defining what’s okay and what’s not okay for you in your relationships, work, and personal life. It’s a way to protect your energy, honor your needs, and maintain healthy connections—without guilt or burnout. Since you’re reflecting on promises and follow-through, boundaries tie in perfectly: they help you decide what to commit to, what to say no to, and how to keep your word without overextending yourself. Here’s a breakdown to chew on, based on what’s known about the topic and how it might connect to your daily self-questions.

#### Why Boundaries Matter

Boundaries are NOT walls to keep people out ... they are guidelines [for your own self-discipline] to let people (and MOSTLY yourself) know where you stand. 

Boundaries have to be rooted in self-respect and clarity of priorities. 

Without this level of self-awareness and discipline, you might say yes to every GoFundMe, every request, every tug on your heart ... and then overpromise, pile on extra obligations, and end up being unable to focus on your key priorities, while also feeling resentful or drained by everything that you failed at.

With boundaries, you can follow through on what aligns with your values and let go of what doesn’t—whether it’s a promise to someone else or yourself.

#### Types of Boundaries

Think of boundaries as lanes in your life. Here’s what they can look like:

Emotional: Protecting your feelings—like not taking on someone else’s drama.
Ex: “I won’t let guilt push me to overpromise today.”

Physical: Guarding your space and body—like needing alone time.
Ex: “Did I carve out time for myself today, or did I give it all away?”

Time: Controlling how you spend your hours—like saying no to last-minute requests.
Ex: “Did I protect my focus today or let others steal it?”

Mental: Defending your thoughts and opinions—like not overexplaining yourself.
Ex: “Did I stand firm on a promise I couldn’t keep?”

Material: Setting limits on your stuff or money—like not lending what you can’t spare.
Ex: “Did I give more than I could afford today?”

#### How to Set Boundaries

It’s not rocket science, it might be harder. It takes guts. 

Here’s a practical rundown:

Know Your Limits: Reflect on what exhausts you or makes you feel off. Did you promise something today that left you stretched thin? That’s a clue.

Be Clear: Say what you mean—no hints. “I can’t take that on right now” beats “Maybe later.”

Start Small: Test it out. Skip a nonessential promise today and see how it feels.

Say No Without Apology: You don’t owe a novel. “No, I can’t” is enough.

Expect Pushback: People might not like it at first. Hold your ground anyway. If you don't see pushback, you probably haven't set the boundaries where they have to be.

Check In: Ask yourself, “Did I honor my limits today, or did I cave?”

#### Connecting It to Promises

Your question about following through on promises—and whether you’re too aggressive or not aggressive enough—lives in boundary territory. Overpromising? Weak boundaries. Not stepping up? Maybe you’re too guarded. Boundaries help you find the sweet spot: committing to what you can handle and letting go of the rest. 

For example:

“Did I say yes today when I should’ve said no?” (Time boundary)

“Did I keep a promise to myself, like rest, or ditch it for someone else?” (Emotional boundary)

“Did I promise something I didn’t have the bandwidth for?” (Mental boundary)

#### What Boundary Experts Say [In What IS Their Area of Expertise]

Therapists like [Nedra Glover Tawwab](https://x.com/NedraTawwab) (who's forgotten more about this than you'll ever know) emphasize that boundaries aren’t selfish—they’re survival. She’d argue **you can’t pour from an empty cup**, so saying no to some promises lets you **say yes to the ones that MATTER**. [Brene Brown](https://x.com/BreneBrown), another voice on this, ties it to courage: it’s brave to **disappoint someone [who might be a professional *needster*] rather than betray your Creator or your soul. 

All boundary experts would tell you that your daily reflection needs to include something along the lines of, “*Did I set a boundary today that kept me on track for my goals, for my sanity, for my Creator's purpose for my soul*?”

#### A Few Questions to Ponder

As you’re building that list of ten BIG questions, here are some boundary-flavored spins on your promise theme:

Did I promise only what I could deliver today?  

Did I say no to a request that would’ve broken me?  

Did I guard my time today or let it slip away?  

Did I keep a promise to myself as seriously as one to others?  

Did I push back when someone tested my limits?  

Did I overpromise because I didn’t want to upset someone?  

Did I set a line today and stick to it?  

Did I give myself permission to step back from a commitment?  

Did I honor my needs before agreeing to something?  

Did I let guilt blur my boundaries today?

Boundaries are a muscle, like courage is a muscle — stretch them, push them, use them, and even flex them so that they get stronger for when you NEED them. They’re not about being rigid or brittle or mean; they’re about being real and beign tough enough when it matters. As you mull over your promises, think: Are you setting yourself up to follow through by knowing your edges? Or are you promising the moon because you haven’t drawn a line? 

One last thing to ponder as you think over this material ... *what part of this really *clicks* for you today OR feels like it will be toughest to apply?*
