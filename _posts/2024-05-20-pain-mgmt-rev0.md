The weekly MelonCave podcast episode is available at [Meditative Pain Mgmt and Why Human Cognitive Processing Power Per Watt Dominates](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103/site/meditative-pain-mgmt-and-why-human-cognitive-processing-power-per-watt-dominates).


## NOBODY has the capacity to undestand your pain better than YOU.

Sure, you can get outside help [and maybe should AFTER you can make an informed choice about who that help should be] ... but NOBODY is really going to understand your pain better than you. It's IMPOSSIBLE for anyone else to understand your pain better than you.

It's not just your neurophysiology ... it's everything else about the pain and how it is driven by your food/lifestyle/exercise choices ... your injuries ... your economic worries ... your concerns about what the pain means for you to do what you need to help those you care about ... NOBODY has the capacity to undestand your pain better than YOU.

It's IMPOSSIBLE.

You can AVOID confronting your pain ... but that pain will not go away and the side-effects of swallowing something are GAURANTEED to make you worse off ... it does not matter if you drink alcohol, use heroin or taking prescription painkillers ... if you just SWALLOW SOMETHING, rather than managing the pain -- the side effects of repeatedly swallowing more and more something will give you more and more ALWAYS NEGATIVE side effects.

So you can avoid LEANING IN on your pain ... but you will pay for your cowardice.

# Autodidactic Training In Cognitive Strategy Discipline

Pain management discipline is NECESSARILY autodidactic ... you really have to UNDERSTAND what autodidactic training is and embrace autodidactic training or you are just not going to be able to tailor your own programming ... you cannot afford to just blindly be the guru of some master -- you have to be in the driver seat of defining your own autodidactic training syllabi.

Doing that is easier with better information technology tools ... for example, an AI Assistant like Claude can furnish you with a roadmap for your training programming of study, but that's ONLY a roadmap -- you drive to drive it yourself AND you have to pay attention to what the map is telling you and whether that map is congruent with the situation in front of you -- but an AI assistant like Claude can spit out an OUTLINE of training for you faster than you can type up a start of an outline yourself ... but even then you will need to be able to delve into terminology [using things like Wikipedia] and the latest research [using things like PubMed] to understand the map that Claude is giving you ... but terminology and the state of the research are not sufficient -- you will need to put that information into practice ... with the pain in your own life ... and, after you have elevated yourself beyond simply being a moaning blob of flesh in pain, you will probably need to consult a professional to give you different insights what you might be missing when it comes to your pain. But you HAVE TO BE INFORMED and able to understand what the professional is telling you ... you cannot afford to just be a tourist on a cruiseliner [where EVERY last thing you can think of is taken care of for you]when it comes to your own pain management.

The cognitive strategies for dealing with serious pain are somewhat like those that are taught to intelligence operatives who will likely be tortured ... it's relatively simple to understand what those strategies involved ... it's pretty much ALWAYS about *leaning in* to the pain and using pain as tool to train the mind, ie it's NEVER about being magically pain-free or even more pain-tolerant or swallowing some painkiller ... the pain ain't gonna stop coming when you're being tortured ... there's NO SUBSTITUTE for using every pain that comes up as opportunity to TRAIN ... there's no substitute for doing the reps yourself ... doesn't matter if you attend some school or training bootcamp as some sort of TOURIST student... you will have to go home and do the reps yourself ... most people don't; particularly when it comes to cognitive strategies for pain mgmt ... because the topic of YOUR PAIN is kind of ordinary, tedious and never goes away, ie *it's easier to swallow something.*

# Syllabus for a year-long graduate level or post-graduate level study 

What follow is only a SUGGESTED outline of an intensive multi-disciplinary curriculum drawing on knowledge from medicine, nursing, psychology, physical therapy, complementary medicine, theology, and other fields to provide a holistic and integrative approach to pain care ... if you don't like this outline, and you probably should have reasons why YOUR outline could be a lot better -- you should come up with your own outline.

The point this syllabus is to put it INTO PRACTICE IN PAIN MGMT EXERCISE OPPORTUNITIES IN ONE'S OWN LIFE ... to **emphasize** non-pharmacological pain management strategies including meditation, prayer, and neuroexercise ... although resorting to the *nuclear option* ... in small doses, eg taking an aspirin, OR going full out to destroy the mind and end the pain ... is always an option. The curriculum is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of individual learners, with opportunities for self-directed study, group discussion, and hands-on practice.

The coursework spans from fundamental pain concepts to advanced subspecialty considerations. Modules incorporate readings, lectures, case discussions, practical exercises, and reflection on the spiritual dimensions of pain and its relief.

**The inescapablity of inevitable pain of one sort or another is THE DEFINING REALITY of the human condition.**

## Course Objective

The **OBJECTIVE** of this course of study to **develop a personalized pain mgmt training discipline for improving cognitive strategies** that one uses every day to research, implement, and practice. The discipline of these practical cognitive strategies for pain management must be implemented through a neuroexercise workthough routine that involves guided imagery, visualization and self-hypnosis for pain management ... so that when pain arises, we learn as much as possible from pain and take time to notice how we react to it, **rather than running from it.** 

*We might ultimately take a small dose of aspirin or other painkiller, but the objective of this methodology is to FIRST observe the pain, pehaps takes notes on how it feels and where it is located, and then to take a few minutes to breathe deeply and relax ... some might take a few minutes to visualize the pain leaving our body ... but most importantly, we must take a few minutes to notice how our mind reacts to the pain and to observe our objective thoughts and emotional feelings about it.*

Th objective IS NOT about some form of magic ... we are not expecting that pain just magically goes away ... we are simply going to be more DISCIPLINED about reaction to it ... we are NOT going to hide from it and we are NOT going to rush to nuke it with painkillers -- we are going to OBSERVE and be more DISCIPLINED in our response TO REMOVE THE HYSTERIA AND OVERREACTION. 

Pain is a part of LIFE and a blessing in terms of the information our own lives as well as the empathy for others that the signal pain provide ... the objective is building this cognitive discipline is to reduce the noise and increase the value of the signal. **DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM**

*Changing the psychological stance towards pain is the first step in actually USING pain as a aid to improve our lives and the lives of those around us ... because the Reality of coming across physical, emotional, spiritual pain that won't leave us alone in our lives just ain't going away for any of us*.

## Introduction and Fundamentals (20 modules)

1. **The [neurophysiology of pain perception](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=neurophysiology+of+pain+perception&filter=simsearch1.fha&filter=simsearch2.ffrft&size=200)** ... it is necessary to delve into the intricacies of [nociception](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470255/#:~:text=Nociception%20refers%20to%20the%20central,the%20activation%20of%20these%20pathways) as well as [the theory of pain and pain perception](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545194/). Given an [understanding of pain's comlexity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10672144/), we should question long-standing beliefs like the cerebral-centric view of pain, the forgotten role of the peripheral nervous system in pain chronification, misconceptions around central sensitization syndromes, the controversy about the existence of a dedicated pain neuromatrix, the consciousness of the pain experience, and the possible oversight of factors beyond the nervous system.  

2. **Cognitive and emotional factors influencing pain** ... as Aristotle said, “*pain is quality of ALL senses*” ... **Comprehending pain as an experience necessitates a deep understanding of the complexities inherent in consciousness.** Recent research against this theory suggests that rather than processing pain-associated information, it processes salient sensory information significant to the organism without an evident specificity. Contemporary theories, in line with consciousness models, propose pain from a Bayesian Model that perceives pain consciousness from a probabilistic and inferential approach, influenced by both current sensory information and past experiences. In this light, we cannot detach pain experience from consciousness research. In the past decade, pain awareness has been attributed to a possible specific neuromatrix composed of various brain regions. The specificity of the [mind-body interaction in the “*pain neuromatrix*”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2738609/) has been debated and is the subject of different attempts [using functional neuroimaging of chronic pain mechanisms to learn about "*centralized" pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4289059/), highlighting [the inherent complexity of pain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38002692/). With the advent of cognitive neuroscience, pain is often presented as a primary output derived from the brain, but this must align with [George Engel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_L._Engel)'s generally accepted [Biopsychosocial Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model) which views pain as the result of complex interactions between biological, psychological, and sociological factors, which suggest that any theory which fails to include all of these three constructs of pain, fails to provide an accurate explanation for why an individual is experiencing pain, eg the individual might be under severe financial stress OR has obligations to others or difficult situation at work and is simply overwhelmed by the pain and what uncertainties and worries or fears that the pain triggers. This paradigm shift was indeed important and brings forward potential misconceptions and over-simplifications, that suggest a person **really shouldn't** *just go to the doctor to get a treatment or a prescription for some pills* to deal with pain ... *there's way more to it than just physiology.*

## How efficient are human brains at processing complex neuroprocessing?

The REASON that we want to explore cognitve strategies to manage pain is that the human brain is BARELY UTILIZED because most people are devoting their brain's processing power to RUNNING FROM PAIN ... or running from tedium and tried to hide from their feelings of of worthlessness [which are fully justified by their own subconscious which is screaming at them "Stop WHINING! Get off your ass or get out of bed and DO SOMETHING!"] ... so as a result of completely failed approaches to cognitive strategies, starting with something like pain management, most humans are not even using a full percent their brains to that 1 per cent's fullest capacities.

*Don't believe me!* ... think for yourself ... [listen to somebody like Jim Keller on open source, hyper-innovation, why RISC-V will quickly be obsolete and the foreseeable next decade or two of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EAY4UzPD0Y&t=954s) ... the hype of AI is not as big as AI is going to be in the realm of computational power.

To cut to the chase, the obvious takehome LESSON from the front of the front lines of chip designers building chips for AI is that the design of the next generations of silicon computing architecture is that silicon can only take us so far -- at a certain point in the realm of AI HYPER-INNOVATION, silicon cannot get out of its own way as old machines have to be decommisioned after a few weeks in service because of obsolescene ... **humans need to start getting really serious about LEARNING to really use their brains and retraining their brains scientifically taking advantage of their carbon-based neuron's neuroplasticity ... human's at first, need to level up their think game to achieve use of at least a few percent of their brain's capacity.**

The human brain consumes approximately 20 watts of power on average ... but generally much less, maybe only a couple watts or even a fraction of a watt in a meditative, but aware state ... brains are subject to fritterware, bad relationships, ***stupidfuck salesguys who should have their melons caved in*** and distractifying technology ... worse, many people do not ever address the causes of their attention deficit ... many humans crave the dopamine hit of maintaining a state of hyperarousal and they do not feel comfortable unless their brain is typically multitasking ... most human brains [in affluent cultures] are probably dominated by programmed worries and fears from a human's media consumption ... it's important to stress the importance of Melon Cave being, first of all an ANTI-media media ... it's IMPERATIVE that people shut off their media and regain control of their own minds. 

The human brain's power consumption is a relatively small amount compared to many electronic devices ... it's not even equivalent to the power required for a light bulb and on average less than even the consumption of a flashlight. Despite the brain's low power consumption, it is enormously efficient and powerful in terms of processing. The average human brain is estimated to have the equivalent processing power of slightly more than 1 exaFLOP (1 quintillion or 10^18 floating-point operations per second); as with all human attributes there are probably humans with capacities that double this. Oddly enough, the human processing power of 1 exaFLOP is comparable to what is currently the world's very most powerful supercomputer, which has a peak performance of 1.1 exaFLOPS. OBVIOUSLY, the problem with most human brains is that they are not being used in a focused manner, with the majority of an individual brain's processing power actually devoted to serving the individual's own best interests ... let alone, not being used to their fullest capacities ... which would be far beyond the 1 exaFLOP estimate, if humans actually trained their brains as athletes strength train for jumping ability. Also, we certainly know that humans are natively better at processing the highest human emotions, eg showing love/empathy or creatively commanding the battle in problem-solving strategies for gigantically important problems.

A really high-end computer workstation used for computer-aided design (CAD) or as a high-end game rig will typically consume between 500-1000 watts and some might even consume close to 2000 watts under peak, depending on the specifications and workload ... whereas an average desktop computer or miniPC will consume about 1/10th of what a high end workstation does, but still 10X more than the human brain. The world's world's most powerful supercomputer (as of August 2023): The Frontier supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States has a power consumption of approximately 21 megawatts (21 million watts) when running at full capacity. The Frontier supercomputer has a peak performance of 1.1 exaFLOPS.

It is true that modern smartphone has lower consumption than a human brain, since it typically consumes around 2-5 watts when in use, and less than 1 watt when idle ... HOWEVER most of the processing power of smartphones is actually used to distract or hyperarouse human beings ... a smartphone is actually more akin to a high end workstation being shutdown by a false warning from a connected printer telling the user that the printer has an urgent error with a partially full ink cartridge ... MOST OF THE TIME, smartphone should be isolated from its owner. As we all forget, the human owner is practically the LAST person on Earth who is actually in control of the processing power of a smartphone. It might seem severe to those who are addicted to their smartphones, but not exactly wrong to say that humanity would probably be better off if the smartphone-as-tethering-device to control humans were never invented ... VERY FEW people are actually remotely close to being able to even think about UNTETHERING themselves from their smartphones.
