This post is an introduction to my [Melon Cave podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103), which goes to the heart of why I work on something called [Transformative Discipleship Technology (TDT)](https://markbruns.github.io/objectives/2024/12/22/Z.html), which is about things like neurohacking, developing one's self-awareness and meta-cognition skills, thinking about the large-language learning models or LLM of AI *think*, using AI as a cognitive-support technology **to assist me in better programming myself to ditch the bad habits of being myself.**

The [Melon Cave podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103) is about me and my struggles to CAVE IN the MELONS of the personal demons that I am battling ... because those demons stop me from ditching the bad habits of being myself ... and it is those bad personal habits stop me from achieving my most important personal [Objectives](https://markbruns.github.io/Objectives).

Yes, OF COURSE ... this kind of material is terribly self-absorbed, terribly autobiographical ... too effing bad -- it's basically stuff that I ***should*** listen myself ... I don't really care if other people listen or don't listen ... I put it into the podcast format for me to listen to -- so, I guess that's just that's how things work ... so I'm not really apologizing for the personal or self-absorbed nature of this [Melon Cave podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103) ...  ... programming myself is what [Transformative Discipleship Technology (TDT)] (https://markbruns.github.io/objectives/2024/12/22/Z.html) is about, ie *trying to benefit others in exactly the same way that I would want to benefit from content myself* ... thus, we have the [Melon Cave podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103).

Hopefully other humans, who might face similar struggles, can benefit from hearing me talk about how impossible these demons have been for me to battle ... but I really do not care if people listen or not. I just want to talk about my demons, and my spiritual battle against them ... it is absolutely a ***spiritual*** sort of battle.

I fully believe that one of the hardest battles any human can ever fight is to battle against the bad habits of being ourselves ... overcoming fear or worry or doubt or laziness or some other deeply, deeply personal flaw or shortcoming ... it's about developing the *little* disciplines, in order to have the discipline muscle to be able to fight larger battles is what I am talking about.

Other people will have different struggles, different obstacles that they overcame ... but they overcame their personal demons by ruthlessly caving in the melons of those demons ... and Melon Cave is not special ... it's just one guy's story about CAVING IN the MELONS of his personal demons.

***Lent offers a particularly COMPELLING time for thinking about giving up old comforts and views that have hung around just because it's oh so convenient*** to avoid taking on the PAIN that comes from battling the demons that lead one astray. Those demons have power over us precisely because they are so familiar, so COMFORTABLE, so CONVENIENT -- those demons have the bags of candy that we can't say no to, so we keep our personal demons around ... but Lent is for giving up comfort, giving up convenience and think seriously about what is stopping us from being more effective at helping people. 

We could say that the self-compassion of this nature, or battling one's own demons, is really a big part of the the basis for compassion for others ... but it can't even be about us, or about some nebulous bullshit that falls under the heading of ***Personal Growth***.  Battling our personal demons is MOSTLY about being the warriors that God created, even though we're long overdue in stepping up. We cave in our personal melonsso that we can move forward and actually finally achieve what our Creator created us to achieve. Sure, almsgiving and trying to really help others is a big part of what Lent is for ... any moron can do checkbook charity or whip out the credit card and send $ ... however, this is much more PERSONAL and raw.  

And this cannot aimed at someone else ... my Melon Cave podcast is entirely about MY personal demons. I say that because I know that it's really, really, REALLY important to avoid ever judging someone else -- and of course, I subconsciously do it ... but if I ever realize that I have started thinking that I could help pick the mote out of someone else's eye, then I KNOW that it's a strong signal that I need to focus on dealing with the BEAM of ROUGH-HEWN TIMBER sticking out of my own eyesocket.

During this season of Lent AND I intend to make an annual tradition of this, I am trying harder to renounce my demons ... because it's not about ***Personal Growth*** ... it's because as a Christian, I am obligated to spend this season [*counting THE COST*](https://www.gotquestions.org/count-the-cost.html) per Luke 14:28. The fact of the matter is that allow I have accepted Jesus Christ as my savior long ago there are old demons who have gotten in the way of me FULLY appreciating the cost that was paid. It's time for those demons to have their melons caved in, and those demons are:

## 1.  **Lack of Discipline:** I grapple with inconsistency, which is somewhat driven by my aptitude for easily acquiring skills. 

My inconsistency is MOSTLY driven by my laziness in continously improving self-discipline in all facets of my life. Being blessed with an aptitude to pick up things is no excuse for laziness. This laziness has resulted in a deficiency in honing and mastering skillsets. Doing hard, frustrating things is necessary for sustainably improving my levels discipline for complex projects and ventures requiring more prolonged effort. My tendency towards mercurial, agile, rapidly-adaptive behavior is not exactly something I want to lose, but relying upon it hinders or sabotages my ability to maintain steadfastness.

### Scriptural Basis For The Larger Strategy of Caving In The Melon Of This Demon

* "For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control." (2 Timothy 1:7)

* "Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable." (1 Corinthians 9:24-25)

* "Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be sober-minded; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed." (1 Peter 1:13)

## 2.  **Absence of Humility:** While I intellectually understand humility, I often operate from a perspective of high self-efficacy.

I exert a lot of effort to quietly be a high-agency person. I vehemently reject any perception of victimhood and resist assistance, asserting my self-sufficiency.  I am offended when someone tries to help me. This inclination, I suspect, is viewed by God as amusing, lamentable and probably even pathetic and WEAK.

### Scriptural Basis For The Larger Strategy of Caving In The Melon Of This Demon

* "But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” (James 4:6)

* "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves." (Philippians 2:3)

* "Before destruction a man's heart is haughty, and before honor is humility." (Proverbs 18:12)

## 3.  **Egotism:** Particularly in situations that evoke insecurity, such as professional interactions or familial scrutiny.

I tend to dominate conversations, especially in situations where I feel that I have something to prove. Instead of fostering dialogue by doing more to encourage others to share. Pauses tend to intimidate me even when I am not conscious that I am feeling intimdated. As a result, I often fill silences with my own perspectives. Part of this tendency stems from a perceived obligation to entertain, to lead, to carry the interaction; I am under no such obligation, but when I am tired, depressed or not thinking clearly I am subject to this faulty perception.

### Scriptural Basis For The Larger Strategy of Caving In The Melon Of This Demon

"Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person." (Colossians 4:6)

"A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion." (Proverbs 18:2)

* "Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise; when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent." (Proverbs 17:28)

## 4.  **Negativity and Judgment:** I can be negative or rush to judgement in viewing situations that are beyond my direct responsibility. 

This manifests as a harshly critical and reproachful attitude, marked by uncharitably low expectations of others and a tendency to aim low or underestimate of their efforts. I am particularly prone to judging others' struggles with their stupid self-defeating behaviors, a reflection of my own past and potential present challenges -- the answer is rooted in a lack of faith and spiritual discipline.

### Scriptural Basis For The Larger Strategy of Caving In The Melon Of This Demon

* "Therefore **encourage one another and build one another up**, just as you are doing." (1 Thessalonians 5:11)

* "Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the beam that is in your own eye?" (Matthew 7:3)

* "Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved." (Psalm 55:22)

## 5.  **Inappropriate Humor:** I have a strong tendency to find humor in others' struggles, particularly when those struggles are related to material concerns.

It's one thing to worry about how we will manage the immediate day, but worrying excessively or obsessing about material wealth, particularly when it is seen as indicator or status or value of a person actually IS INSANELY STUPID. I have learned over time that I will find a way to adapt, adjust, improvise, overcome ... and even without my own efforts ... it is CERTAINLY true that people of faith should understand why, by the grace of our Creator, we are directly admonished by Jesus Christ not to worry about such things. Since worrying about material well-being is a sign of stupidity for me, I often dismiss anxieties about financial comfort as trivially hilarious, believing that affluence contributes to dissatisfaction. Of course, this inclination reflects an unkindness towards those who express financial worries; I should not find humor in their struggles *but I do*.

### Scriptural Basis For The Larger Strategy of Caving In The Melon Of This Demon

* "A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones." (Proverbs 17:22) However, this does not give us permission to make fun of others struggles.

* "Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep." (Romans 12:15)

* "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear." (Ephesians 4:29)

## Conclusion

It will, of course, be a longer haul than just 40 days of Lent ... my [personal objectives](https://markbruns.github.io/Objectives) represent a continual, year-round commitment to achieving things that are personally vitally important to me ... but during Lent, I need to work a bit harder, thinking about what comforts and conveniences that I need to give up ... there are excuses and psychological comforts in these these particular faults that I need to do without.

By acknowledging these weaknesses and grounding my efforts in scripture, I HOPE to cultivate greater self-awareness and spiritual growth. *I would ask people to pray for me, but* I suppose I will egotistically say something like "These are my crosses to bear." I guess I would rather have them make jokes about what an idiot I can be ... but I realize that people might be intimidated by the judgemental asshole I can be.

In the final, most concluding of concluding remarks, these five things are what I believe:

1) I DO have all the answers; *just ask me* ... ***I actually am joking***, can't resist it, the assertion that I know the answers is the kind of thing that's supposed to be funny -- the HARD truth is that caving in the melons of my personal demons will be a much longer haul than just 40 days; if I have 40 years left to live, even that amount of time will be insufficient.

2) Being NICE is closely aligned with PURE evil ... basically a MATCH for it. The most wicked demons have big bags of sweet candy of exactly the kind that we dream about ... the mostly evil demons are FULL of platitudes about kindness, compassion and NICE WORDS ... caving in the melons of personal demons requires ACTUAL action ... and repentance and begging for forgiveness when the backsliding happens ... but it's like any recovery plan that has a PRAYER of actually working -- it requires acknowledging a Higher Power AND that means telling those who are merely NICE to fuck off.

3) I am not a nice guy or a reasonable; I have not intentions of becoming a nice or reasonable guy. I am RAW and brutally FRANK, because I trying to be as HONEST with myself and others as is possible ... and my intention is to become a better disciple of Jesus Christ ... that doesn't mean being a nice guy like someone's IMAGINARY sunday school Jesus -- it means being a RAW, brutally FRANK, HONEST ... as close to Jesus as possible ... Jesus who was never exhibited any fear of either embarrassment, demons, the baddest of bad ass centurions, or even groups of people in dominant governmental empires or sanctimonious religious bodies. If Christians were actually more like Jesus, there would not be any problems evangelizing the One Way to God.

4) I actually realize that I am quite vulnerable, but also still mean as fuck ... *so don't get any ideas* ... once again, ***that's a joke, it's supposed to be funny, even though it isn't*** -- the point I am attempting to make is that I'm vulnerable and I don't care. My soul is more important.

5) We are all spiritual beings. We have souls, unless we believe and go out of our way to CHOOSE to act as if we are soulless. We get to choose. Our spiritual essence transcends all time ... which means that when we pray to be WITH God, to have his Will be done -- that means that we ask that God be with our SOULS, not our egos and not our psychological personnas ... we ask God to give our souls the grace of being filled with the Holy Spirit and we try to ditch our egos and try to ditch the VERY TEMPORARY notions of *personal* growth. This is about becoming the spiritual being that God created us to be.

Hopefully, this explains WHY this lenten season before Easter offers a particularly COMPELLING time for kicking off this Melon Cave podcast ... now is the time to CAVE IN the MELONS of my personal demons.
