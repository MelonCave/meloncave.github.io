I have been SEARCHING for a clearer, better, more succinct statement of value propositions that captures the essence of this MelonCave project. It's about the intersection of Christian spirituality, applied cognitive neuroscience, and personal transformation through disciplined practice ... ***but what does that even mean?*** 


# 100 Proposed Beat Meditations on The Melon Cave Value Proposition

*Achievement is mostly about what obstacles we remove, removal of the self-made walls, "What stands in the way...becomes...the way!*


***Caving in the melons*** of our personal demons is how we overcome the bad ingrained habits of being ourselves which keep up from attaining the kind of personhood we were created to exhibit. The podcasts have a strong biblical grounding and also bring various from of anti-materialistic, habit-changing wisdom from various philosophical and scientific traditions, but reflecting an integrative and loving approach ... obviously, this easier said than done but the direction of the body of work will become more evident as we work through the process of generating and reflecting upon this content.

Ultimately, our value will come down to our body of work and how it has helped others, maybe helped us help others. 

To understand where we're going with that work, you can look at the 100 value propositions for Melon Cave. Each statement below is paired with both biblical grounding and wisdom from various philosophical and scientific traditions, reflecting an integrative approach ... but the direction will become more evident as we work through the process of generating and reflecting upon this content.
