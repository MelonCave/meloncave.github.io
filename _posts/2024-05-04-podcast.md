**Here's the [TRAILER for the ***Melon Cave*** podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103/introducing-melon-cave-the-anti-media-media).**

## THIS is the repository

Melon Cave is an ANTI-media media. This forkable, shareable, extensible open source GitHub Repository is about the writing necessary for building the scripts that will become the five-minute weekly podcast.

You have a soul ... that means you don't need someone else's sermons ... you wouldn't make yourself into a car if you physically hung out in your garage, even if you did it regularly, even for 24 hours/day -- you are not going to make yourself into a Christian by having your butt in some seat in some building. Why are you worshipping celebrities or pharisaical figures of authority? Why have you abdicated your spiritual sovereignty? YOU have to be in control of your prayer life ... it's important to understand what it means we say that 'Melon Cave is open source ANTI-media media.' 

The [weekly ***Melon Cave*** neuroexercise workout podcast](https://sites.libsyn.com/499103/) is not really aimed intended for anyone to *just* listen to ... but you are welcome to follow along ***WITH THE PROCESS of building it.***

You are also more than welcome and definitely encouraged to fork this repo and build a better neuroexercise podcast project for yourself ... *because doing it yourself would be far better than wasting your time* **just listening** *to the Melon Cave podcast* ... you have a soul; you should not need someone else's sermons ... stop following celebrities, stop playing church, stop longing for a great performance from the pulpit ... BE the life that defines your own media.

The sole purpose of this introspective journalling neuroexercise is to help ***us*** [if you choose join me] ... CAVE IN THE MELON ... by working on our own melon ... as well develop skills in DAILY prayer, DAILY journaling, DAILY training ... we take back ownership of our souls ... and all of the little things like re-writing, revising, speaking, rewriting again, refactoring the material, speaking and recording, and editing audio content and supporting artifacts and accoutrements [so that we or anyone who wants to can come back and revise it, reproduce it later].

## The Neuroexercise Syllabi Method

The Melon Cave ***daily*** journaling discipline about the process of *doing the heavy lifting, mentally* EACH DAY, THROUGH THE WEEK to really dive deeply enough into a serious investigation of a topic and develop different syllabi, one each week, for different neuroexercises in training the mind.

Each day, the point of the daily journaling activity revolves around sketching out the outline of a new 200-module syllabus ... that someone might use for a year-long course of study ... it's really about an IMMERSION process; the point of developing a syllabus each week is to really OVERWHELM THE BRAIN.

Each day, the journaling neuroexercise about *putting the leaves on the branches of the tree* of a high level outline. Doing this will involve some relatively deep dives into various topics in hardwiring the brain ... this activity is a matter of neurohormesis ... getting the maximum survivable dose -- and then letting the subconscious turn over the factoids.

Instead of comfortably just listening to another stupid podcast ... **the SYLLABI OUTLINE format is about working much more aggressively on taking advantage of human neuroplasticity in order to push human intelligence to new levels.**

***WHEN YOU ARE ACTIVELY TRAINING ... your brain is ALWAYS a work in progress!*** ... but if you're NOT actually really training ... let's say you're just a teevee watcher, a movie watcher, a sports fan, a social media ***follower*** ... then, ***as a passive consumer of content, you are only FOOLING yourself***. You are not actively training your mind ... your brain, in that case, is a work of deteriorating regress to zombie couch mashed-potatoness.

What is shown below is AN EXAMPLE of the initial [*AI-PROPOSED SYLLABUS*](https://claude.ai/chat/) ... it starts off next to nothing, but it IS a start. At first, it's nothing but an EARLY ROUGH DRAFT of an OUTLINE such a syllabus ... after we have made edits and revisions EACH DAY, it will still obviously not really be anything more than the START of a work in progress ... but the week's worth of daily journaling should be good enough for giving us the prep for doing a five minute WEEKLY podcast. 

The value of the initial [*AI-PROPOSED SYLLABUS*](https://claude.ai/chat/) is that it gives us a starting point for STRUCTURE for what we are going to think about in our daily journal ... as we do more and more of these, our ability to write decent prompts for the AI assistant will improve, so the proposals we get back will get better ... the AI Assitant itself will improve; the companies behind the AI assistants may add better *pro user* features or APIs that we can exploit programmatically ... but, in all serious training regimens, we must recognize that have to start somewhere.

Obviously, even our daily journal edit and refactoring of these proposed outlines are not meant to be taken as a final product ... *maybe there is no final product* ***other than our own brains*** ... neuroexercise is like any other form of exercise -- you have to **do it with the correct form and intention** because doing it ***right*** helps build the discipline or *muscle memory* that you will need to rely upon to *just do it* without thinking about it. 

**A plan to get on going is fine, but at some point, you have to actually LIFT THE WEIGHT and LIFT THE WEIGHT CORRECTLY.**
