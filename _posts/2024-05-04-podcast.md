## The Podcast

This repository is for holding the material to develop scripts for a five-minute daily podcast called [***Melon Cave.***](https://five.libsyn.com/show/episodes/view/31126668)

The podcast is not aimed about YOU ... but you are welcome to follow along. You are welcome to fork this repo and build your own daily journal podcast.

The sole purpose is to help us ... CAVE IN THE MELON ... by working on our own melon ... as well develop skills in DAILY prayer, DAILY journaling, DAILY training ... and all of the little things like re-writing, revising, speaking, rewriting again, refactoring the material, speaking and recording, and editing audio content and supporting artifacts and accoutrements [so that we or anyone who wants to can come back and revise it, reproduce it later].

## It's about WORKING THROUGH different syllabi for training the mind

Each day, the point of the daily journaling activity revolves around sketching out the outline of a new 200-module syllabus for a year-long course of study that involves a deep dives into various topics in hardwiring the brain and working aggressively on taking advantage of human neuroplasticity in order to push human intelligence to new levels.

***WHEN YOU ARE ACTIVELY TRAINING ... your brain is ALWAYS a work in progress!*** ... but if you're NOT actually training, like let's say you're just a teevee watcher, a movie watcher, a sports fan, a social media ***follower*** -- then, ***as a passive consumer of content, not actively training your mind ... your brain is a work of deteriorating regress to zombie couch potatoness.***

What is shown below is AN EXAMPLE of the initial [*AI-PROPOSED SYLLABUS*](https://claude.ai/chat/) ... it's next to nothing ... nothing but an EARLY ROUGH DRAFT of an OUTLINE such a syllabus, but it is a START ... after we have made edits and revisions, it will still obviously not really be anything more than the START of a work in progress. 

The value of the initial [*AI-PROPOSED SYLLABUS*](https://claude.ai/chat/) is that it gives us a starting point for STRUCTURE for what we are going to think about in our daily journal ... as we do more and more of these, our ability to write decent prompts for the AI assistant will improve, so the proposals we get back will get better ... the AI Assitant itself will improve; the companies behind the AI assistants may add better *pro user* features or APIs that we can exploit programmatically ... but, in all serious training regimens, we must recognize that have to start somewhere.

Obviously, even our daily journal edit and refactoring of these proposed outlines are not meant to be taken as a final product ... *maybe there is no final product* ***other than our own brains*** ... neuroexercise is like any other form of exercise -- you have to **do it with the correct form and intention** because doing it ***right*** helps build the discipline or *muscle memory* that you will need to rely upon to *just do it* without thinking about it. 

A plan to get on going is fine, but at some point, you have to actually LIFT THE WEIGHT and LIFT THE WEIGHT CORRECTLY.

### The EXAMPLE syllabus of neuroexercise -- improving Christian prayer life

The proposed outline is meant to be the starting point for an ongoing internal monologue that we might have with ourselves, focusing on the general map or high-level overview that the syllabus is about.
