Salebarn.com will primarily be an open source technology project ... we'll see if it develops into a business ... at this point, any discussion of the NEED for Salebarn or ruminations on a business plan are only for the purposes of describing the target use case for the open source technology project.  The PRIMARY or core technology of Salebarn is DISRUPTION and its disruptive engine AI deep learning tool which will utilize data obtained from the Salebarn messaging infrastructure.  The Salebarn messaging infrastructure will be an adaptation of ZeroMQ or Nanomsg or NNG.

# How the world arrived at NNG

Why did Martin Suskirk rewrite ZeroMQ as Nanomsg?  Why did Garrett D'Amore morph Nanomsg into NNG?  The history of NNG is not trivial and is worth exploring.

# How Salebarn will use NNG

The main technology of Salebarn.com is disruption ... ultimately that DEMANDS low-latency communication for product exchanges and the marketing negotiations that drive the Salebarn.com business.
