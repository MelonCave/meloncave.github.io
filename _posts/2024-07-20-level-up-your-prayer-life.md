At its core, Melon Cave is about compactification, ie Melon Cave is about *SQUASHING the same old, tired rotten bullshit* that we find being pushed by pretty much media and entertainment organizations. Melon Cave is ANTI-media media.

The whole point of this exercise is to break down complexifications and nebulous gas into dense, solid and useful sparks which are the basis for the genesis of discipline.

In other words, humans NEED to STRUGGLE, FAIL, ENDURE a bit of discomfort or pain ... in order to really engage the processes of neuroplasticity in our subconscious realignment of tangled, complex problems that we are nauseating familiar with ... slogging through struggle, failure, discomfort is necessary for us to really understand tight cogent USEFUL strategies.

## The most fundamental push of Melon Cave is NOT about the uselessly simplistic strategy of keeping things simple ... it's about the tough, hard work of ***MAKING*** things simple.

There are important exercises and practices that are part of stimulating neuroplasticity and what might be most important is how SIMPLE these exercises and practices actually are ... arguably, the single most important practice or discipline that one can build upon is to continually return to center, to be in state of ***continual prayer*** ... and we should spend some time thinking about exactly what that involves.

Prayer is both SIMPLE ... and it is dreadfully DIFFICULT, because it's absolutely not expressing some bullshit childlike wish to a Santa Claus like genie or granter of wishes.

The most fundamental thing about prayer is that it is about the ***RELATIONSHIP*** with one's Creator ... if you don't get that prayer is fundamentally about a continual, nonstop ***RELATIONSHIP*** with that which created everything about the Universe and the laws governing everything that happens in the Universe, then you totally do not get prayer at all, ie *you might as well go sit on some dirty old pervert in a Santa Claus costume and ask for everything you want, like a clueless little girl.* 

But there's a lot more to prayer ... so as a fan of prayer, I am working on a DRAFT of an outline for syllabus for a 200-module (daily, year-long) graduate/postgraduate level course on improving Christian prayer life with deep dives into associated topics:
