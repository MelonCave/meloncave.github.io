At this point, this page is just a placeholder ... for now it's a TBD List of AWESOME Lists.

Yeah, we are fans of [Joe Foss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Foss) and his brand of freedom, but in this repository, this kind of *freedom* is about FREELY extensible, open source sortware. Freedom is always a good thing and **Discipline Equals Freedom!**

## FOSS is Free and Open Source Sofware

Curating and annotating these awesome lists is all about jumping off points for ideas ... these listings are all about open source PROJECTS that we think are pretty darned AWESOME.

# Open Source Projects We LOVE ... And Hope To Contribute To

1) **READING** might be thing we need to improve most ... [extending/enhancing Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/get-involved/#development) ... this goes way beyond *just* the 100,000 emails we get every year and the daily work of keeping the daily email fetch down to a manageable 250-300 emails/day. Reading ALSO goes way BEYOND *just* the thousands of RSS feeds from our professional and technical interests that we try to stay on top of. We simply cannot read enough. We need to read even more but *there's only so much reading that is humanly possible!*  So we NEED help ... we need to develop ***much smarter*** *READING technologies* and along with just the tech, we need an even better set of best practices for sharing and communicating about what we have read with others ... but it is the ***much smarter*** *READING technologies*  that we develop with others for our shared needs that will help us to READ more, READ better, READ faster and to generally accelerate our ability to coherently, professionally process more information. *Accelerate the practices for READING, accelerate the READING tools, and accelerate the accelerated development of READING tools* ***so that we are able to slow down and THINK.*** Doing this is really going to be about understanding how the best developers have been dogfooding their own toolkits for the last few decades. We might start by looking into the [Thunderbird development community](https://developer.thunderbird.net/thunderbird-development/getting-started) ... which uses the [Mercurial distributed version control system(DVCS)](https://wiki.mercurial-scm.org/Download) rather than the [Git DVCS](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) [*and just the topic of comparing DVCSs and DVCS practices including distributed issue tracking and distributed code review by itself is an extremely important facet of distributed development*] ...moreover, the Thunderbird community itself is also important since it is part of the foundation of developing different web technologies, including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript at [Mozilla's Developer site MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) ... or, instead of *just* working on the tool itself, we might contribute to the Thunderbird website, this documentation, or addons.thunderbird.net through the [repositories and their issue trackers on the Thunderbird GitHub page](https://github.com/thunderbird). It's worth repeating for emphasis that *dev'ing Thunderbird, and using Mercurial and Git, is really about understanding how the best developers on the planet have been dogfooding their own toolkits for the last few decades* ... and ***the important stuff is still to-this-very-day all dev'd with plain old email!***  Tech is all about ***READING.***

2) **DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL** At first, we just want to master [bread-and-butter, baseline, STANDALONE basic Git commands](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday#STANDALONE) ... then, with experience, we move on up to the [more participatory form of Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday#_individual_developer_participant) to the [project integrator level of Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday#_integrator) to [repository administration level Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday#_repository_administration)... until we reach the point where [whole Git landscape](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) makes some sense ... then, since we care about the Git tool, we subscribe to the [git mailing list](git@vger.kernel.org) or, at least, try to follow the major developments from that list with the summarized [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) ... but practically, it really gets into *USING* Git with the [best Gitflow practices](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow) or what might be even better, the [GitLab Flow Best Practices](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-are-gitlab-flow-best-practices/) ... which are mostly about doing code review better and things like [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) ... although some of it is about *shifting left further* to use intelligence in the linting/testing/debugging/dev'ing that happens even before code review with a ***GitDeep*** implementations of [generative AI foundation model](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/4f68e07c6c3173480053fd52391851d6f80d651b/On-the-Opportunities-and-Risks-of-Foundation-Models/graph) or a quasi-proprietary, branded approach like [Gitlab Duo's Generative AI Coding Methodology](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/07/20/supercharge-productivity-with-gitlab-duo/) ... but all of these practices, depend upon really internalizing the thinking behind the entire GitLab CI/CD toolkit ... or using a similar GitHub-centric approach with [thousands of Actions to automate a development workflow](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&utm_campaign=2024Q2-Learning-Pathways&utm_medium=product&utm_source=github) like [the OpenCommit AI tool for improved commit messages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/opencommit-improve-commits-with-ai)... but it's all about making the most of what others have done and what sorts of *free* resources are available for open source developers, such as taking advantage of GitLab/Github Pages for development documentation.

3) TBD ... there are lots of little [Apps](Apps.md) we could build ... or might try to build ... at with any app that we envision, we FIRST want to develop an awareness of what else is already out there and build upon what thousands of others are useing, rather than first trying to re-invent our own INSANELY STUPID private-invented-here *Javascript* *React* *Angular* *Python library* snowflake thingey ... but we might want to brainstorm a curated list of the top 25 or 100 or so apps that we will try to be *thinkering on* in our campaigns.
