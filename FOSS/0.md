Melon Cave is all about using Transformative Discipleship Technology (TDT).

TDT is about using all the resources available to improve cognitive awareness, to apply neuroscience and to develop Christian mindfulness discipline. This reaches into areas like neurohacking, developing oneâ€™s meta-cognition skills, become a more proficient human-in-the-loop (HITL) of H-I-T-L machine learning and AI systems, thinking about the algorithms of large-language learning models (LLM) of AI think, using AI as a cognitive-support technology.

In other words, TDT is about taking advantage of the neuroplastic brain given us by our Creator to *program ourselves* to work more diligently on removing the bad habits of being ourselves and to improve our discipline as disciples of Christ.

**Discipline Equals Freedom!** and we apply our freedom to **transform our ability as disciples!**
