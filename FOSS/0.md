Yeah, we are fans of [Joe Foss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Foss) and his brand of freedom, but in this **repository**, the word *freedom* is about FREELY extensible, open source spiritualware ... it's all about our habits, our brains, taking advantage of the neuroplasticity given us by our Creator to *program ourselves*.
