# Melon Cave Value Proposition

Identifying a specific problem for a specific audience, articulating how the product/service solves the problem, and communicating the audience-specific benefits of the solution is what the [list 100 meditations below](#100-proposed-beat-meditations) or [a list of 100 more](#100-more) is about. Developing beat poetry and songs about these proposals helps transform vaporware into something that is at least potentially memorable. 

**Ventures or activities like this PROPOSE or intend to create VALUE** -- ideas have to start being developed into something with a proposal ... but ultimately, of course the **value** we actually create comes down to our whole body of work ... what is learned from that work, through that work ... ideally, *maybe* how that work has helped others ... *maybe* ... the only certainty is that we MUST give the glory to our Creator. 

Sometimes, maybe the whole point of the exercise just a matter of dealing with our issues and self-impediments ... so that we can get past the crap, *cave in the melons* of our personal demons ... and maybe be able to try to help us help others, but we keep our aspirations simple, humble. 

***Caving in the melons*** of our **personal** demons is how we work on ourselves to overcome the bad ingrained habits of being ourselves ... it is those bad habits, driven our personal demons, which keeps us from attaining the kind of glorious personhood we were created to exhibit.

**Achievement is mostly about what obstacles we remove, removal of the self-made walls, "What stands in the way...becomes...the way!**

I have been SEARCHING for a clearer, better, more succinct statement of value propositions that captures the essence of this MelonCave project. First of all, it is REALLY personal ... *that means ME* ... it's about autobiographical, self-referential study of material at intersection of Christian spirituality, applied cognitive neuroscience, and effecting personal transformation through disciplined practice ... ***but what does that even mean?*** 

The Melon Cave podcast is about practical applied cognitive neuroscience ... discipline improvement with a strong biblical grounding ... also bring various from of anti-materialistic, habit-changing wisdom from various philosophical and scientific traditions, but reflecting an integrative approach ... it's important to ***do everything with love, out of love***.

Obviously, improving discipline is a lot easier said than done ... even with divine assistance ... but the direction of the body of work will become more evident as we work through the process of generating and reflecting upon this content. To understand where we're going with that work, you can look at the 100 value propositions for Melon Cave. Each statement below is paired with both biblical grounding and wisdom from various philosophical and scientific traditions, reflecting an integrative approach ... but the direction will become more evident as we work through the process of generating and reflecting upon this content.
