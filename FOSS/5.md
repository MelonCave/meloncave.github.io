## 100-Module Transformative Prayer-Centric Christian Time Management Training

This 100-module course is prayer-centric in order for us to maximize our time in prayer. Ultimately, it's about getting things done in the most efficient, fastest, cheapest, best manner because it begins with prayer, adding biblical wisdom while incorportating the structure of the best available, most practical time management and project methodologies known to human kind. Each module provides insights from secular thought leaders in order to help understand how the world thinks AND a scriptural reference to guide our prayer-centric approach, creating a comprehensive approach to stewarding time as a sacred gift from God.  

*The POINT of this whole approach is that treating time management as a stewardship discipline means that we must realize that we are not alone in this. We are not just some mere mortal screwing around, wasting our time like a dawdling immature teenager -- the time and resources we manage on this project known as our existence belong to the Creator.*
