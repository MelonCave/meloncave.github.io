## 25 EXCUSES that people give for not wanting to live in the NOW:

You will hear all of these GARBAGE excuses ... especially from SENILE OLD kooks who are stuck in the past OR from the pain-avoidance losers, alcohol users and people who rely on painkillers, whose thinking you should avoid like the plague ... **you have to focus on NOW, especially when NOW involves real pain.**

### 1. Most of what we worry about never actually happens ... ***REALLY?*** This is the reason that people give for using painkillers or alcohol or hiding from REAL PAIN.  That pain is there for a reason. It's true that catrasphosizing over phantom pain or other hyperbloviated shit in the world that's in the news ain't gonna matter, especially political shit ... the fearmonger over political shit will not EVER matter. But if something painful is happening to you [or someone you care about] right NOW and you know that it's real and not some phantom or dream, then it's happening to you FOR A REASON and as long as you don't understand the root cause of that reason, that bad thing IS GUARANTEED to happen to you again and again and again and over again ... until you DO understand the root cause of what is giving you pain right now, you will be fucked by your hiding from your REAL pain.

### 17. Worry often subsides if you connect with others authentically
