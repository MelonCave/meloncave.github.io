Salebarn builds tools to be absolutely MANIACALLY focused on accelerating a negotiation in a way that involves SERVING qualified, paying customers.  

In order to serve that paying customer with an efficient, satisfying, beneficial accelerated negotiation ... we must find ways to engage QUALIFIED customer; we don't want to waste ANY of the time or attention span of people who are not interested OR will never be able to complete a negotiation ... it USED TO BE that this involved getting out and meeting people and making 25 new face-to-face contacts per day with potentially interested people, advertising and interesting target populations of potential customers in a product, putting up a high-quality bricks-and-mortar store OR holding really entertaining promotional events or auctions ... communication technology, social media and smartphones has revolutionized how these things are done, but even though the approach might be different those tactics are still being used effectively and, to the extent we can make those tactics even more effective, much less costly, much more rapid and generally more satisfying for all involved, new communication networks, information technology and independent providers like can play a role ... but there's no role for anyone who makes things more difficult, less efficient slower.

The focus of Salebarn is not on the technology, technology helps us implement tools -- the Salebarn repeated mantra, our maniac focus is on the accelerating the PERFECT negotiation ... that means STARTING off with the correct group of potential customers so entrepreneurs can better find, engage and SERVE QUALIFIED PAYING CUSTOMERS.  

# The Ideas-To-Value Funnel

PROSPECTING, first and foremost, is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme ... prospectors who get into the game thinking they will get rich quick end up buy all kinds of gear they don't need from people who do get rich quick selling overpriced stuff to greedy SUCKERS.

You cannot be a greedy SUCKER ... you are not going to find enough BIGGER suckers to buy your worthless second-rate product.  Prospecting is NOT about getting your share of a shrinking pie -- although competition definitely matters and there's a place for advocating, advertising and promoting a good idea -- prospecting must fundamentally be about increasing the size of the pie, or you are wasting everyone's time.

Building, maintaining improving a prospecting funnel is really about developing something that will provide a foundation of wealth generation in an antifragile manner ...  the simple construct of a funnel or sieve allows us to use technology to look at the universe of ideas and to narrow the universe down to a practical set of things that represent the highest and best value of everyone's time. We must look ahead to what we want to see; a simple model or construct provides the vision that informs our more concrete goals as we work out practical details and overcome minor frustrations and little problems. But we do need to look at the BIG picture -- to THINK BIG. Ideally, we should envision a system where all involved in terms of things that you can enjoy working on in order to accelerate the process of to provide legitimate value for others [and yourself].  


## I. Your perspective restricts your UNIVERSE of ideas

The FIRST restrictor in the funnel is about largely involuntary restrictions on your perspective.  Instead of NARROWING this perspective -- we want to think about works at EXPANDING your horizons and really achieving this is HARD.  VERY hard.  Regardless of how large it is, it has to get a lot bigger.  Your horizons necessarily have to be much LARGER than everything that you can merely Google ... one of the necessary things you must do in order to expand your perspective is to stop wasting time fitting into human boxes ... reduce the time you spend watching TV, looking at things online, reading books, merely FOLLOWING other ideas. You probably need to increase the amount of spend time in nature, hiking, walking, thinking, meditating, praying, fasting or engaged in the duties of [extreme ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2) ... do not just follow someone else -- DO EXTREME THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER in order to create, learn, explore and expand your horizons ... get out of your comfort zone; broaden your own perspective.


## II. Sticky, monetizable ideas that, at minimum, lend themselves to loyalty programs and distributed peer-to-peer ledger database accountability

The second restrictor in this prospecting funnel is about narrowing your choices from your BIG PERSPECTIVE.

Specifically, the second restrictor is constraining the set of all possible ideas in the universe, to the set of ideas that are valuable enough that they could possibly make money. When you are WORKING in the realm of IDEAS that are may be of monetary value to other productive human beings who have money [and not simply scams to get or take things from other human beings OR to merely be wealthy, powerful or famous], you will SERENDIPITOUSLY discover and build all kinds of brand new useful things, like open source software repositories, that are inordinately valuable to others, even those without money ... but you NEED at least a small amount of money to sustain your ability to be creator of art or writer of useful open source repositories ... so FOLLOW the MONEY!

 To most effectively look at monetization, we need to look at HOW money works and why humans use money.  Money has been the way human beings keep score. It will probably always be necessary for humans to keep score with some sort of loyalty system or way to incentivize participation. Enlightened monetization, therefore, is really a matter of removing the waste, fraud and abuse from the score-keeping systems humans use to track wealth. An example of a more efficient, robust and anti-fragile score-keeping system are the metrics used by Github. Earlier, but still important score-keeping systems were the reputation management systems of Ebay or StackExchange.  Before that were things like frequently-flier miles, hotel loyalty programs and free-sandwich punchcards used by fast food vendors ... before that we can look at things like Gold Bond stamps or Betty Crocker points.  


## III. Thiel's Zero-to-One and laying the foundations for the the most scalable, biggest impact ideas.

The startup cookbook approach is the next set of funnels and sieves.  There are seven big Questions that all potential business ideas must consider -- these Questions effectively provide ways of winnowing down the massive amount of ideas we have in the hopper.

1. **The Engineering Question**:
Can you create breakthrough technology (vs. incremental improvement)?

2. **The Timing Question**:
Is now the right time to start this particular business?

3. **The Monopoly Question**:
Are you starting with a big share of a small market?

4. **The People Question**:
Do you have the right team?

5. **The Distribution Question**:
Do you have a way to not just create but **deliver** your product?

6. **The Durability Question**:
Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?

7. **The Secret Question**:
Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?

AFTER we narrowed our list in this fashion, the next thing to look at is SCALEABILITY ... that is basically the next heading.

## IV. Scalability and antifragile community husbandry processes

Professional brand management and different social commerce strategies are starting to mature. We can look at what works, what doesn't.  What we are really looking at here are inclusive networks with built-in incentive structures (see above material) that go beyond merely spreading ideas, but enlist people to take them further, develop and extend the ideas for their purposes and yet continue to participate in advancing the value proposition of the general idea.  

This stages gets to be partly about LETTING GO ... not just giving others the opportunity to USE and OWN the idea, but encouraging them to hack something bigger.
