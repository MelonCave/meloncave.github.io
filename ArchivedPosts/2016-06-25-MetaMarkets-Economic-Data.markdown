Not all data are created equally.  Some data really matter because they are the artifacts of serious choice by people with scarce resources to allocate.  

Data that is an artifact of a REAL economic transaction is actually really valuable, by comparison ... if we consider things like a search engine requests or some sort of social media inference or psueudo-meaningful quasi-real transaction, eg. a "Like" on FB or LinkedIn or upvote on StackExchange, with sort of just data about potential interests or preferences or even boredom.  Things change significantly when real money gets spent.

One example of a company nudging in the more meaningful niche in this realm is [MetaMarkets](https://metamarkets.com/blog/) which specializes in programmatic ad [and ad buy data, analytics and tracking data, etc] using its own technology stack that is built end-to-end for speed, flexibility, and the power to handle huge volumes of programmatic ad data. Programmatic advertising dwarfs Wall Street in data volume, growth, and complexity. It is arguably one of the most complex marketplaces ever created and it's still being created everyday.

Another company with a more active strategy to acquire more valuable data is [Premise](https://www.premise.com/), an economic data collection and aggregation company, which just received [$50 million in series C funding](http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/24/premise-raises-50-million-to-outsource-the-collection-of-economic-data/). Premise is a SaaS provider that uses 25,000 “contributors” in 32 countries and tasks them with photographing and otherwise documenting economic data in order to provide customers like the World Bank with highly valuable information. Premise has boots on the ground who will show up at grocery stores and send back information that Premise’s data analysts then parse.

There are other opportunities in economic data being created every second; for example, we can think about rapidly emerging communities like crowdfunding or bitcoin that did not exist a decade ago OR we can think about how [data and data APIs have become the means for building communities and expanding networks](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/5-ways-to-increase-api-adoption/analysis/2015/06/12).  Markets that more free than ever is particularly interesting and that is the realm that Salebarn is exploring ... things like peer-to-peer distributed exchanges, smart contracts and revolutions that continue to break out in freelancing, remote working, microwork, app hubs and developments like [reposium](https://medium.com/college-cryptocurrency-network/reposium-dco-the-future-of-wikipedia-4be080cfa027).
