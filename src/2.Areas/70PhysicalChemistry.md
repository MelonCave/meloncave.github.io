[Physical chemistry](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/category-dashboard/605c72ef153207001f6470cf) applies physics to chemical systems, studying thermodynamics, kinetics, and quantum mechanics. It uses spectroscopy and computational models to understand molecular behavior. Applications include reaction dynamics, surface science, and photochemistry.
