[Systems Biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/systems-biology) integrates data from genomics, proteomics, and other omics to model complex biological networks and interactions. It uses computational approaches to predict system behaviors in health and disease. This field advances holistic understandings of organisms and personalized therapeutic strategies.
