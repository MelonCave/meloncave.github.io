[Genetics](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/genetics) studies heredity and variation in organisms, focusing on genes, chromosomes, and inheritance patterns. It includes classical, molecular, and population genetics to understand traits, mutations, and gene regulation. Applications span agriculture, medicine, and forensics, such as gene therapy and genetic counseling.
