### [9. Hydration, Circulatory Pathways or Meridians](https://ancientguy.github.io/9.html)

The hydration section examines personal hydration patterns, awareness of subtle physiological signals, and considerations for water quality and sourcing. Questions explore strategic timing of fluid intake, environmental factors affecting hydration needs, and connections between hydration and various body systems. The section addresses common hydration challenges, monitoring methods, and special considerations for aging individuals with specific health conditions. Special attention is given to integrating optimal hydration with other health practices and approaching water consumption as a spiritual practice of gratitude and stewardship. The questions culminate in reflecting on hydration as an act of honoring one's God-given body through mindful care and appreciation for this essential element.

*Stop treating your body's interconnected flow across and through a network of channels or meridians like it's just like plumbing, wiring or cabling or some technician's quickfix afterthought while pretending to honor God with your temple. Get serious about circulation across and through the meridians. You aren't ready to die YET!*
