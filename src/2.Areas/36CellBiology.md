[Cell Biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/cell-biology) focuses on the structure, function, and interactions of cells, including organelles, cytoskeletons, and membrane dynamics. It explores processes like cell division, signaling, and differentiation using microscopy and molecular techniques. Insights from this field are crucial for understanding development, disease, and regenerative medicine.
