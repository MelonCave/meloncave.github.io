[Evolutionary Biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/evolutionary-biology) explores the processes of genetic change, adaptation, and speciation over time in populations. It integrates genetics, paleontology, and ecology to study natural selection, phylogeny, and biodiversity origins. Insights reveal how organisms adapt to environments and inform conservation and medical evolutionary strategies.
