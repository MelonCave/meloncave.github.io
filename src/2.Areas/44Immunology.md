[Immunology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/genomics) examines the immune system's components, responses, and regulation in defending against pathogens and maintaining homeostasis. It covers innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, and vaccine development using cellular and molecular approaches. Research advances treatments for allergies, infections, and immunodeficiencies.
