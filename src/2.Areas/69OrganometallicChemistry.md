[Organometallic chemistry](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/category-dashboard/605c72ef153207001f6470d6) explores compounds with metal-carbon bonds, bridging organic and inorganic fields. It studies reactivity, bonding, and catalytic applications in synthesis. Key areas include transition metal complexes for cross-coupling and polymerization.
