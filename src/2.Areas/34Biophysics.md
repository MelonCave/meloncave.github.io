[Biophysics](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/biophysics) uses physical principles to study biological phenomena, from molecular dynamics to cellular mechanics and organismal functions. It employs techniques like spectroscopy, microscopy, and mathematical modeling to quantify processes such as ion channel activity or protein conformational changes. This field enhances our understanding of life processes and informs developments in medical imaging and nanotechnology.
