[Cancer Biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/cancer-biology) examines the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving uncontrolled cell growth, metastasis, and tumor formation. It investigates genetic mutations, signaling pathways, and the tumor microenvironment to uncover how cancers evade immune detection and resist treatments. Research in this area supports the development of targeted therapies, biomarkers for early detection, and strategies for cancer prevention.
