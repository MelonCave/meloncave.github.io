[Scientific Communication and Education](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/scientific-communication-and-education) focuses on disseminating research findings and teaching scientific concepts effectively to diverse audiences. It explores methods for writing, presenting, and educating in STEM fields, including public outreach and pedagogy. This area enhances science literacy, policy influence, and training of future scientists.

[EdArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv) is a free, open source, non-profit service that allows education researchers to post
and search working papers, unpublished work, conference materials, and articles under review. EdArXiv accepts any content which is a complete research product. This is typically presented as an academic paper with an introduction to the topic of research, description of the research
conducted, a description of the results from the research, and a general discussion of the findings and implications of the research. Though journal articles fit this description, many other products do as well, including honors theses, masters theses, dissertations.
