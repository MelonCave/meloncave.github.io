[Bioengineering](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/bioengineering) applies engineering principles to biological systems, designing tools and technologies for medical and environmental applications. This interdisciplinary field includes biomaterials, tissue engineering, and biomedical devices like prosthetics or drug delivery systems. It aims to solve real-world problems by integrating biology, mechanics, and computation to improve health and sustainability.
