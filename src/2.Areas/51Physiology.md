[Physiology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/physiology) studies how organisms, organs, and cells function to maintain life, including homeostasis and responses to stimuli. It covers systems like cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine using experimental models. Insights inform medical treatments, exercise science, and adaptations to extreme environments.
