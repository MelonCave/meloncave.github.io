[Synthetic Biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/synthetic-biology) engineers biological systems by designing and constructing new genetic circuits, organisms, and biomolecules. It applies principles from engineering and biology to create tools for medicine, energy, and materials. Challenges include ethical considerations, biosafety, and scaling up synthetic designs.
