# biorxiv Extremophile Engineering

## Metadata

This Project was created on `2025` `10` `28` with the template located at `.foam/templates/projects.md` in an attempt to optimize the machine-readability for automating notes in the future, using [note properties](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/note-properties.md), [templates](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/templates.md), and [graph visualization](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/graph-view.md). 

As with most tools, [**Foam** *is like a bathtub -- what you get out of it depends on* ***what you put into it each day.***](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/index.md). Minimizing context-switching is a matter of daily repitition and discipline built upon reviewing and better using [essential VS Code keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings). This even goes beyond the [Foam extension's VS Code shortcuts for note-taking](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/getting-started/note-taking-in-foam.md#keyboard-shortcuts). 

### GitHub Functionality For Discussions, Issues, Projects

In addition to VS Code and the Foam extension, we will rely upon the GitHub Discussion and Issue functionality, BEFORE graduating something to "Project" status ... when something becomes a Project on GitHub, it will simultaneously become a PROJECT in our P.A.R.A. hierarchy. Please abide by the GitHub progression from ... [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) ...to... [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/guides) ...to... [Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects):

* [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) are mainly for just discussing something, to clarify terminology or ask questions or for just generally speculative thinking out loud.

* [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/guides) are for things that somebody really needs to look into and possibly turn into more of a Project.

* [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) are adaptable task-boards or roadmaps that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan, visualize and track your work effectively. 

### P.A.R.A. Project Mgmt Review

A Project is the start of a bigger development commitment and the basis of the P.A.R.A. method of the [*Building a Second Brain* (BASB)](https://fortelabs.com/blog/category/building-a-second-brain/) methodology. The P.A.R.A. ***methodological architecture*** systematically manages information differently than mere notetaking apps:

* **PROJECTS**, have SMART goals, minimal completion reqmts and deadlines
* **AREAS** are about roles/responsibilities or obligations or capabilities ... **Areas** are the preferred destination for **Projects**.
* **RESOURCES**, mostly finished AREAS, but also ongoing interests, assets, future inspiration, may req continual maintenance and refactoring but, for now, are *backburner*able  ... **Resources** are the preferred destination for **Areas**.
* **ARCHIVES**, inactive matl from P A R that is kept around only for informational purposes.

## Project Goals

*Specific, Measurable, Aggressive, Realistic, Timebound objectives ... these are GOALs for stretching what we hope to achieve, rather than non-negotiable, minimal-acceptable ultimatums as Requirements and Deadlines are*.

## Project Requirements

*We aggressively manage the scope of Projects for MINIMAL VIABILITY requirements for completion and handed-off advancement to the Areas section.*.

## Project Deadlines

*Time DEADLINES are not goals, but rather firm drop-dead dates after which we don't bother anymore*.
