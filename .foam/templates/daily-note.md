### Preliminaries

*Delete everything in Heading before saving daily journal.*

Customize and tweak the [**daily journal**](https://github.com/AncientGuy/PKM/tree/main/journal) format using `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` ... using the following variables in the template:
- `${FOAM_DATE_YEAR}`: The year of the date
- `${FOAM_DATE_MONTH}`: The month of the date
- `${FOAM_DATE_DATE}`: The day of the date
- `${FOAM_TITLE}`: The title of the note

Try to start each day's work on this PKM, but focusing for 25 minutes on review/refactoring/daily discipline for VS Code, to minimizing context-switchings builds upon using [essential VS Code keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings). This should go beyond simply mastering [Foam extension's VS Code shortcuts for note-taking](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/getting-started/note-taking-in-foam.md#keyboard-shortcuts) and the [recommended extensions for Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/getting-started/recommended-extensions.md); for example, it may be good to occasionally peruse [materials on ***logsec***](https://github.com/logseq/awesome-logseq?tab=readme-ov-file#-guides-and-how-tos) or maybe [the Obsidian blog](https://obsidian.md/blog/) or to ask an AI for [recent BASB atomic note-taking refinements](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMi1jb3B5_3024d9b4-4e52-4c05-890c-6d4fd4ac1358). 

As with the use of any tool, [***daily*** disciplined use of **Foam** *is like a bathtub* -- **what you get out of it depends on what you put into it.**](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/index.md). Our own cognitive rewiring through daily notetaking is an especially important exercise -- we want to deliberately take some time to sharpen our own cognitive skillset with these most basic facets of how advanced toolsets are used. 

If one wants to optimize the machine-readability for automating notes in the future, it's necessary to to get practice with using things like using [note properties](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/note-properties.md), [templates](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/templates.md), and [graph visualization](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/graph-view.md).
