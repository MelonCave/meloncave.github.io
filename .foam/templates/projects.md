# ${FOAM_TITLE}

## Summary

This Project was created on ${FOAM_DATE_YMD}.

### Customize this template

Customize the `.foam/templates/projects.md` ... using the following variables in the template:
- `${FOAM_DATE_YEAR}`: The year of the date
- `${FOAM_DATE_MONTH}`: The month of the date
- `${FOAM_DATE_DATE}`: The day of the date
- `${FOAM_TITLE}`: The title of the note

Remember, minimizing context-switching is a matter of daily repitition and discipline built upon reviewing and better using [essential VS Code keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings). This even goes beyond the [Foam extension's VS Code shortcuts for note-taking](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/getting-started/note-taking-in-foam.md#keyboard-shortcuts). If one wants to optimize the machine-readability for automating notes in the future, it's necessary to to get practice with using things like using [note properties](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/note-properties.md), [templates](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/templates.md), and [graph visualization](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/graph-view.md). As with most tools, [**Foam** *is like a bathtub -- what you get out of it depends on* ***what you put into it.***](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/index.md).

### GitHub Functionality For Discussions, Issues, Projects

We will rely upon the GitHub Discussion and Issue functionality, BEFORE graduating something to "Project" status ... when something becomes a Project on GitHub, it will simultaneously become a PROJECT in our P.A.R.A. hierarchy.

Please understand the GitHub progression from ... [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) ...to... [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/guides) ...to... [Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects).

[Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) are mainly for just discussing something, to clarify terminology or ask questions or for just generally speculative thinking out loud.

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/guides) are for things that somebody really needs to look into and possibly turn into more of a Project.

On GitHub a [Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) is an adaptable task-board or road map that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan and track your work effectively. You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, grouping your issues and pull requests, visualize work with configurable charts, and add custom fields to track metadata specific to your team. Rather than enforcing a specific methodology, a project provides flexible features you can customize to your team’s needs and processes.

### P.A.R.A. Project Mgmt Review

A Project is the start of a bigger development commitment and the basis of the P.A.R.A. method of the [*Building a Second Brain* (BASB)](https://fortelabs.com/blog/category/building-a-second-brain/) methodology. The P.A.R.A. ***methodological architecture*** systematically manages information differently than mere notetaking apps:

* **PROJECTS**, have SMART goals, minimal completion reqmts and deadlines
* **AREAS** are about roles/responsibilities or obligations or capabilities ... **Areas** are the preferred destination for **Projects**.
* **RESOURCES**, mostly finished AREAS, but also ongoing interests, assets, future inspiration, may req continual maintenance and refactoring but, for now, are *backburner*able  ... **Resources** are the preferred destination for **Areas**.
* **ARCHIVES**, inactive matl from P A R that is kept around only for informational purposes.

## Goals

*Specific, Measurable, Aggressive, Realistic, Timebound objectives ... these are GOALs, not hard ultimatums, as Requirements and Deadlines are*.

## Requirements

*MINIMAL VIABILITY requirements for Project completion and advancement to Areas*.

## Deadlines

*Time DEADLINES, not goals, but a drop-dead dates after which we don't bother anymore*.
